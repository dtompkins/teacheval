Working with Patrice is always a pleasure.  This semester went very smoothly, except for the few tutorials I had to miss because of travel plans.  During this time I was nominated by the department for a University-wide TA award but unfortunately I did not win.  I'd like to respond to the one comment below that says I should "...try tutorial problems as soon as they come out..." -- they actually mean *assignment* problems, and I confess that there were a couple of times where new assignments had been posted and students came to me for help before I had the chance to go through the problems.
