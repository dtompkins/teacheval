His presentation is clear and concise. ,,,,,,CS136 provides a fundamental introduction to CS. It teaches students how to solve a problem instead of just coding. ,,,"The students level in CS range from minimal to advanced proficiency. It seems challenging to accommodate everyone in the class. Also, students seem to dislike C as some think that it is not useful for a job. ",,,Dave is really a great prof in terms of caring for students. He was really brave to share his story of mental health with us. I believe it made a great impact on a lot of my classmates.,,,"Perhaps something could be done to address the different level of students in the class. 
Also, perhaps CS136 could add a small lab component. For example, there will be a one question assignment due every Monday. The question won't be worth a lot of marks but it encourages students to stay on top of the material and prepare for the upcoming lecture and homework.
In addition, I personally did not think the tutorial is that useful. In class, when I ask the prof a question, I can be sure that he will give me a 100% correct and concise solution. However, in the tutorial, the TAs are not as good at explaining concepts and answering questions. Perhaps, in the future, the tutorial format could be change (Maybe to a lab?) "

Most difficult concepts became very easy to understand because he would explain them in a way that was relatable. For example, when explaining what low coupling was, he brought up how if your radio stops working, your car shouldn't break down. Another thing is that he was very funny, which helped keep the class engaged in the content. When he was talking about stacks, he made a Community joke where he said if you want to take something off the stack, you ""Pop pop!"" it off. While not a lot of people got it, it is something that will definitely stick with me when thinking about stacks. Whenever he encouraged discussion about clicker questions with our seat neighbours (if most of the class wasn't getting it based on the results), I found that this really helped solidify my understanding  of what was going on. I also liked how he showed 5 minute clips from a movie throughout the term until we finished the movie, as it made people show up on time, meaning less disruptions when class actually started. Moreover, the class recaps at the beginning are a good refresher, and I think it really helps make sure what we learnt the previous class stays in memory. Tuesdays and Thursdays are the days I looked forward to during the week because it meant that I got to go to CS136. I had a lot of really good instructors in my first term, and I didn't expect any of my second term instructors to outdo them. By the second class, Dave had blown away all of my expectations and easily became my favourite instructor. I still think back to when he was describing that in C, we ""call"" a function, and how he pretended to be on the phone and pass arguments to someone on the other line. All in all, Dave is an excellent instructor, and I'd take absolutely any class if I knew he'd be teaching it.",,,"He could use less yellow and green in his drawings on the slides since they don't show up well. Sometimes we fall a bit behind, but I think that it's in the interest of making sure everyone gets the concepts.",,,"With C being fairly low level, it gave us an understanding about a lot of things that go on behind the scenes in other languages.",,,Seashell could be a bit buggy.,,,Only positive vibes in this class.,,,"Class size was good, no students talking really."
