Having both videos and transcripts was useful for those with multiple learning styles.
Fahad and Alison were very helpful.",,,"Each module is available on a weekly basis only, so there is no opportunity to work ahead. The assignments can still be due on a weekly basis but students should be able to read/watch the next modules content if they finish the previous one early.",,,Consider making all the course modules available at the beginning of the term but releasing the assignments on a weekly basis as is already done.

Multiple times, I emailed them because my answers for assignments did not match the answers provided. It turned out that I was correct and the answers were wrong, but instead of informing me they just reuploaded different answers, therefore wasting my time. On other times they just would not answer my questions for a week. And my third issue is that they have posted that a module has been uploaded when it has clearly not been, therefore going against the course schedule and forcing me to rework my workload. Individually none of these things are a huge deal, however after I while I felt as if the ISAs did not care to perform well in their job or aid students, and I felt like I had to berate them into being helpful at all. Thanks. "
