The room I was in (RCH 307) was terrible.  The projector screen completely blocked the whiteboards, which made doing diagrams very awkward.  Half-way through the term I switched to using a tablet pc for the diagrams, and by the end of the term, I was reasonably proficient.<br /><br />

Otherwise, see my comments for <a href="2014-winter-1.html">the other section</a>.
