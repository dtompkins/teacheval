One of the most exciting topics (in my opinion) in undergraduate computer science presented with clarity, relevance to the real-world software, and with humour as well.  I will certainly remember what is an operating system thrashing :)","One minor issue that sometimes arises is that we jump a lot between difficult slides, so maybe the sequencing of slides could sometimes be improved, but this is not a major issue at all.","Four lines are certainly not enough to describe.  this course exercises a highly broad spectrum of programming skills, makes student think about efficient algorithm design and storage complexity (on a ~300kb MIPS machine!) as well as opens students' eyes on how the tools they use everyday actually work behind the scenes.","One thing to consider, which is more of a suggestion than a weak point indicator is bringing in examples from existing open-source OS such as Android or BSD (that, however is just my own personal opinion).",,

I'm not sure if I got used to it later or just began teaching in order.,Never boring (until the last couple of topics).  Use of piazza as a forum and quick responses.,Last few topics were not as enthusiastic.  Some filesystem material may have been helpful to know while doing assignment 2 (open/close/read/write).  Went over A3 material way too early in the term.,,Being in closed room (no windows) is a bit depressing.
2,3,1,2,2,6,2,2,1,2,2,3,2,2,5,,Great personality and uses everyday life situations to relate to the course material for better understanding.,Provide more code related classes corresponding to the assignment.,,Too much source code in the OS 161 to be covered during the assignment.  The instructor could help in generalizing the source code.,Positive.,
