I do believe that's the point of CS 135.","Course's weak points: Some of the earlier lectures were pretty boring, to be honest, for someone who already had experience with programming.

You can tell he really cares about his students and the material. CS135 was the course I was most dreading this semester but it quickly ended up becoming my favourite, in large part due to the amazing instructor. In high school (and even in some courses now) I tended to go over the material on my own at home instead of bothering to follow the lessons, but Dave's lectures are actually helpful and engaging.

I felt that there was little coverage on this function- and I struggled  a lot with one of the assignments even after using the slides, online resources and the textbook. It would have been nice to see more examples.","Other Comments: The class room was very cramped, small and dark- but I guess that's because it was an old building. (Phys Building)"

Gives great pointers and precautions.","Improvements to technique or style: Sometimes cuts students off when they are asking questions. Does not seek class participation very often - unless we catch him making a mistake.
*The Esc+P trick was never taught in class. I was wondering how it was done until we were shown the trick in tutorials. I never would have figured out that it was not actually a Ctrl command.","Course's strong points: Course manages to make a transition to Racket not feel overwhelming. Additionally, course material is more conceptual. I feel like I am working smarter rather than trying everything until something works.
  Assignments are interesting and relevant to course material. Difficulty of assignments encourage us to better understand course material.
  Clickers are a great way to encourage class participation.","Course's weak points: There is a sudden increase in difficulty at around module 8. Assignments suddenly get a lot harder at that point.
  Later assignments were very vague and had unhelpful examples. This is most exemplified in assignment 08. In question #3, nowhere does it state that we are required to count replies of replies, and the examples do not clarify that. It had to be clarified on Piazza, which shows how unclear the question is.
  Some material did not feel useful in the slightest. I never used template functions nor did I ever find them necessary or helpful.
  Tutorials are not very well organized. Gives ""group problems"" but we do not work in groups. We do not have enough time to work on them thoroughly either. Thus, tutorials are not very helpful. This is proven by the number of students who show up for tutorials on week 1 compared to on week 10.","Other Comments: Class size keeps getting exponentially smaller. Worst case I've seen in all of my classes so far.
  Floor elevation was not steep enough. Had trouble seeing over tall people's heads. This is in particular if they had really weird hair.
  People who use Reddit during class time are mildly distracting.
  The audio in Physics 150 took too long to get fixed."

For some questions, it felt more like the writers were attempting to create an extremely challenging question rather than a helpful question. This was the minority of the questions, however. Also, the rigid design recipe was a time waster, which I believe could be better used in understanding the coding practices.
