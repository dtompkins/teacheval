His examples and rough work was very helpful. He was also very passionate about showing us cool stuff which I appreciate. He does a good job at teaching new and experienced coders without confusing too many people.
Course's weak points: I found that some assignments became very hard all of a sudden. I got through it and learned a lot, but it took 24+ hours and there were no directly helpful examples taught in class.
Class atmosphere: Positively, Dave is a funny guy.
Other Comments: Great class

Good,Just Right,Good,Excellent,Excellent,I did not seek help,Interesting,Excellent,90-100%,Very helpful,Helpful,No opinion,Okay,Okay,11-15 hours,"What instructor has done well: Dave's a really fun presenter and he works hard to keep the class engaged.
Improvements to technique or style: Dave's pretty awesome.
Course's strong points: As painful as it was to learn/use Racket, lists, and recursion for tasks that could be far easier completed using a more modern language, it certainly forces you to understand the concepts since there are no crutches, like variables, arrays, and iteration, available. I do believe that's the point of CS 135.
Course's weak points: Some of the earlier lectures were pretty boring, to be honest, for someone who already had experience with programming. That's not really something that can be fixed though, since not everyone taking the course starts at the same level.
Class atmosphere: Not in the least.
Other Comments: I thought the class size and room (PHYS 150) were perfect for the course; the room was small enough to comfortably read the slides, and the class was small enough that anyone could ask questions.

Excellent,Just Right,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,I did not seek help,Interesting,Excellent,90-100%,Very helpful,Very helpful,No opinion,Okay,Okay,3-6 hours,"What instructor has done well: Dave is incredibly funny and engaging while remaining respectful and competent, and I respect him hugely for that. You can tell he really cares about his students and the material. CS135 was the course I was most dreading this semester but it quickly ended up becoming my favourite, in large part due to the amazing instructor. In high school (and even in some courses now) I tended to go over the material on my own at home instead of bothering to follow the lessons, but Dave's lectures are actually helpful and engaging. His sense of humour is very positive and sincere, the kind that makes you smile without making anyone feel bad.
Improvements to technique or style: Everything was fine.
Course's strong points: Assignments were fun and interesting without being too challenging.
Course's weak points: Admittedly design recipe can be very helpful, but having to do it for every function got very tedious and unnecessarily time-consuming. Style guide could be a bit more specific. Sometimes the ""test coverage results"" were kind of too nitpicky for my liking.
Class atmosphere: Dave is a cool, funny, respectful guy, and he creates a very comfortable, relaxed class environment that lets us all focus on the course material while having fun.
Other Comments: The PHYS classroom was kinda cramped. The Lion King movie was a nice touch - made me really want to be punctual. Also my friend is a big fan of Dave's YouTuber cousin, so she's jealous of me now

Improvements to technique or style: Great technique and style.
Course's strong points: Tough questions which require a lot of problem solving. I found racket great for learning programming.
Course's weak points: Quite a bit of focus on stepper questions on tests but almost not instruction on them in lectures.
Class atmosphere: Dave always managed to keep everyone laughing and engaged in class. His humour seemed to bring everyone together.

Excellent,Just Right,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Always,Interesting,Excellent,90-100%,Very helpful,Very helpful,No text required,Somewhat too much,Somewhat too much,7-10 hours,"What instructor has done well: Coding in the class, which makes more clear for us to understand the step.
Improvements to technique or style: Maybe do some extra examples outside the course notes could help.
Course's strong points: Learn how to systematically build a function. Make us a logical mind.
Course's weak points: Assignments are a little bit to hard and the course covers too much modules than cs115.

Improvements to technique or style: I personally LOVE the coded examples done in Racket, I would personally like to see more of this and MORE steppers because our 2 midterms and presumably the final would too.
Course's strong points: Dave's teaching style was very diverse, he included clear spoken lectures with coded examples and even drew some diagrams like trees when we started to learn them.
Course's weak points: Since this is a required class for certain majors, there isn't much motivation to do this course, but Dave made everything more interesting for a lot of people.
Class atmosphere: The class atmosphere was a little bit tense initially due to it being a first year class, but through Dave's humour and interactivity, a nice environment was created that allowed strangers to make friends with other people.
Other Comments: We were in the PHYS150 room and the class was always packed. There isn't much space in between each seat and also between rows, but this is the fault of the room and not much can be done. PHYS was a rather quiet building, so there were little to no distractions during lecture hours.

Many people in CS135 have never programmed before, but Tompkins taught in a way that made even the least confident students feel able and competent. 

Showing a movie for the 5 minutes before class every day was a good idea, I forced myself to get to class on time multiple times for no reasons besides Lion King. All Hail Mufasa!
Improvements to technique or style: I was disappointed that day when we couldn't watch Lion King because someone stuffed the podium with cheese.
Course's strong points: Because we used functional programming, the content was fairly new and engaging for students of all backgrounds and skill levels

Improvements to technique or style: No comments. He is an excellent prof.
Course's strong points: Although there were a lot of assignment questions and it was tough, it was necessary for students to learn.
Course's weak points: Too much material especially the second half of the course when it transitions from locals to lambda.

Improvements to technique or style: some examples could have used more explaination and done more clearly, i.e. initial trees lecture, normally 8/10. 10/10 with further explaination and rice
Course's strong points: Movie clip showed at beginning, overall kept everyone well engaged, inspired us and filled us with determination

Improvements to technique or style: Sometimes talks a little quickly, though the lack of need for taking notes greatly diminishes the seriousness of this issue.
Course's strong points: Lots of feedback, examples, and effort by the instructors and tutorials to get you understanding the material at a good depth.
Course's weak points: The clicker questions all but disappeared by the end of the course, removing a valuable self-assessment tool.

"
Excellent,Just Right,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,I did not seek help,Interesting,Excellent,90-100%,Very helpful,No printed notes,No text required,Okay,Okay,7-10 hours,"What instructor has done well: Dave truly understood us students in the class. He would realize when we were ""zoning"" out while he was lecturing us. Instead of forcing the information on us, he would slightly diverge from the topic and gain our attention through light-hearted jokes or pop-culture references. Once he had regained our attention he would continue lecturing us on the material at hand. I feel that this is one of the strong points of his teaching style as forcing the information on students that have ""zoned"" out would only make them ""zone"" out further.
Improvements to technique or style: Nothing. His teaching strategy was extremely adequate.
Course's strong points: Lectured flowed in an extremely logical manner. The Course is laid out in very nice way in that it makes it easy for students to learn the material. There are no ""vague topics"" in the course. Concepts are covered extremely thoroughly.
Course's weak points: We spent a bit to much time on introductory material leaving perhaps not enough time to cover more advanced concepts.
Class atmosphere: The class atmosphere was definitely positively affected by the instructor's attitude. Dave came to every lecture in an extremely good mood which in turn made the students eager to learn. It was a very happy atmosphere.

The lectures are very easy to understand and the use of ""Racket Hat"" makes the class hilarious
Improvements to technique or style: What is there to be improved on when it is already perfect
But the audio should be improved faster
Course's strong points: The material is very easy to understand after taught by the prof. Very humorous and intellectual teaching style. 
Also, the change in voice for the mutual recursion should definitely be continued. Do have water next to you next time so you don't lose your voice
Course's weak points: The Doctor Racket hat needs to exist in real life!
Class atmosphere: Absolutely positively effective. Everyone fall in love with CS after hanging out with this prof. Also thank you for the empathy when we have a long hw assignment.
Other Comments: The class size is reasonable, but it will be nice if we get to switch seats so we can get to know more people. I still have no idea who is in my cs class up till this point.

Improvements to technique or style: Nothing to be improved.
Course's strong points: Assignments were designed well so that students would understand the material better. Classes were well taught. Concepts were very interesting.
Course's weak points: Classes only being two times a week made it very difficult to remember last lecture's content. Tutorials were not taught well or reinforce ideas properly. A lot of time was spent on easy concepts (before trees) and I think we should have gone through those concepts faster.
Other Comments: I enjoyed the free food.

Makes lectures interesting and fun, I actually enjoy coming to class. Goes over the material at a good pace and answers any questions students have. Loved watching the lion king and the comparison between recursion and drug use. Some of the course material was dry but Dave tried his best to keep everyone awake.
Improvements to technique or style: Only feedback is to have more steeper problems. Otherwise, keep doing what you're doing!
Course's strong points: Learned a lot of basic skills that you will need for future cs courses. I know that this builds a good foundation for cs students and teaches you to think in a problem-solving way.
Course's weak points: Too much material given too fast. It was hard to learn all the concepts. There's still stuff that I don't fully understand and some assignments were poorly organized. The assignment with trees was useless and I still don't know how to use trees or their purpose. Also, assignment 9 was way too hard, I barely understood the concepts and had to implement them in complicated code. 
On midterm 2, the stepper problems were too hard and the overall exam was too long.
Class atmosphere: Positively by both instructor and students.

He teaches CS brilliantly both in depth and in humor. There isn't enough good things to say about him, just that he is the best professor/teacher I've ever had to date.
Improvements to technique or style: I honestly don't think there is really much that he could actually even improve on, given how excellent his teaching was. If anything, just more light sabers and the amazing voice acting! (Don't break your voice though)

Course's weak points: lambda, and the uses of lambda. I felt that there was little coverage on this function- and I struggled  a lot with one of the assignments even after using the slides, online resources and the textbook. It would have been nice to see more examples.

Gives great pointers and precautions.
Improvements to technique or style: Sometimes cuts students off when they are asking questions. Does not seek class participation very often - unless we catch him making a mistake.
*The Esc+P trick was never taught in class. I was wondering how it was done until we were shown the trick in tutorials. I never would have figured out that it was not actually a Ctrl command.
Course's strong points: Course manages to make a transition to Racket not feel overwhelming. Additionally, course material is more conceptual. I feel like I am working smarter rather than trying everything until something works.
  Assignments are interesting and relevant to course material. Difficulty of assignments encourage us to better understand course material.
  Clickers are a great way to encourage class participation.
Course's weak points: There is a sudden increase in difficulty at around module 8. Assignments suddenly get a lot harder at that point.
  Later assignments were very vague and had unhelpful examples. This is most exemplified in assignment 08. In question #3, nowhere does it state that we are required to count replies of replies, and the examples do not clarify that. It had to be clarified on Piazza, which shows how unclear the question is.
  Some material did not feel useful in the slightest. I never used template functions nor did I ever find them necessary or helpful.
  Tutorials are not very well organized. Gives ""group problems"" but we do not work in groups. We do not have enough time to work on them thoroughly either. Thus, tutorials are not very helpful. This is proven by the number of students who show up for tutorials on week 1 compared to on week 10.
Other Comments: Class size keeps getting exponentially smaller. Worst case I've seen in all of my classes so far.
  Floor elevation was not steep enough. Had trouble seeing over tall people's heads. This is in particular if they had really weird hair.
  People who use Reddit during class time are mildly distracting.
  The audio in Physics 150 took too long to get fixed.

Excellent,Just Right,Good,Excellent,Excellent,I did not seek help,Interesting,Excellent,50-75%,Helpful,Helpful,No text required,Somewhat too much,Too much,7-10 hours,"What instructor has done well: Really engages the class. Treats it like a performance, yet teaches everything that needs to be taught, leaving us both entertained and informed.
Improvements to technique or style: Would very occasionally stress and reiterate concepts that need not be reiterated. Asking for a show of hands on who understands the particular point might be an effective method to combat this. However, most of the times when Dave Tompkins stressed a point, it was for good reason and done the right amount.
Course's strong points: Learning recursion so thoroughly and being instructed in a fun way.
Course's weak points: Assignments far too long to complete in a reasonable amount of time, and also at times a bit more complex than I believe is needed to understand the concept. For some questions, it felt more like the writers were attempting to create an extremely challenging question rather than a helpful question. This was the minority of the questions, however. Also, the rigid design recipe was a time waster, which I believe could be better used in understanding the coding practices. I believe that code should be marked for being understandable and correct, not for following a rigid formula of style.
Class atmosphere: Nope. No discrimination.
Other Comments: The room was a good place.
