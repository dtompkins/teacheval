Example: At this time I am on Module 10 and am just getting feedback from Module 6. Not having feedback from previous modules does not help me to achieve a better mark for the next module. Example:  There were 3 Modules devoted to Excel in this course and by the time I got feedback for the first Excel Module, I had already finished the 3rd part and had moved on to a completely different topic.",Agree,3,,Above 90,5,,Elective,1,,Much more than 10 hours,4,,,,Understanding what goes on in the background when you are using a computer.,,,Consistent and timely feedback from assignments,,,"More explicit materials for learning. Videos so that you can see the changes that are happening, rather than text documentation. Transcripts need to be updated to proper sentences and in the first few modules"
