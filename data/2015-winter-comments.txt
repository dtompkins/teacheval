This was the first time I was the <i>"instructor"</i> for CS 100, although I use that term very loosely as I did no instruction. My only concrete contributions were related to assignments and exams.<br><br>

As a result, these evaluations are really more of an evaluation of the <i>course</i>, and not me.<br><br>

I did not change any content for the course.  I was mostly auditing the course to see how it was working (or not working).  I was researching and developing new material.  I  conducted a large survey at the end of course to assess student opinions on individual modules (e.g., which modules were more "useful" or "interesting").<br><br>

I was working remotely throughout the term, and was relying heavily on the ISAs (coop students) and the ISG Coordinator (Barbara) to keep the course running smoothly.
