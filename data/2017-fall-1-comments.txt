I was really looking forward to this term, and it did not disappoint me. In my very first term at Waterloo (<a href="2011-fall-2.html">fall 2011</a>) I taught with Byron, Ian, Troy and Craig and it was an incredible experience.
At the time, I didn't realize just how special it was that a first year course was being taught by such extraordinary faculty members.
We would often reminisce about that term, referring to ourselves as the "Dream Team".
In 2015, Ian proposed that we "get the band back together" and so we all agreed to teach CS 135 again in the fall 6 years later.
We were joined by Paul who was an incredibly hard worker as well.<br /><br />

In short, the term went very well.
However, it was a tremendous amount of work.
The assignments were ambitious, and because everyone was
so experienced, we had many thorough discussions relating to the course content.
Personally, I had a lot of other responsibilities (home life, teaching another course, advising and committee work) that I often found myself overwhelmed during the term, but it was very worthwhile.<br /><br />

As per my ongoing tradition, I showed 5 minutes of a movie before each lecture.  This term the students voted for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4116284">The Lego Batman Movie</a> (Sec 006) and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4302938">Kubo and the Two Strings</a> (Sec 003).<br /><br />

I removed that evaluation from these results, so the data on this website differs from the "official" results posted elsewhere.</span>
