4,,2,,4,,4,,3,,3,,2,,4,,1,,2,,4,,4,,2,,2,,2,,The videos were much better than the written content at the beginning of the class. However some of the questions required a lot of extra research outside of the lectures. The questions asked entailed information we did not learn. I don't think that is fair nor do I think it is worth the amount of money I had to pay for the course.,The Excel videos did not go into enough depth on the subject matter to complete the assignment. Perhaps providing additional links to external websites could help this void. I felt like I was caught in a wild goose chase looking for how to properly complete the assignment. This is not what I expect in a course I pay for. I expect to be taught the content. Instead I had to rely on Google.,,Very difficult assignment questions on content that was not taught in the modules.,,
2,,3,,2,,3,,6,,6,,2,,3,,1,,2,,4,,4,,3,,3,,1,,,,Course is organized clearly.,,,Liking the new video modules.
2,,3,,6,,2,,6,,6,,1,,6,,,This is an online course.,2,,1,,4,,3,,3,,1,,I really enjoyed taking CS! I had very little background on this and found the course very interesting and not too easy nor hard. The posted notes are very helpful online and the assignments were not too hard to do. I really liked the last few modules where we learned from videos since I'm more of a visual learner. I think making videos would help students to learn.,"I would just change that alongside with the videos, include a few notes so that one wouldn't have to go back to the video and try to find the portion where something corresponds to.","Great notes, fair assignments.",,,I really enjoyed this course!

The videos are great for students who need step-by-step help with visuals, but it would be nice to have a powerpoint or note version of the modules as well.",,
