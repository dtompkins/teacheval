He really knew what he was talking about.  He was easy to understand and he really tried to understand his students.  He was so enthusiastic!,Ummmm I'm so happy he's got passion - unlike other profs - that I can't see anything to improve upon.,"It included real world examples, making it easier to understand this was another technique Dave used in extra examples.",The last 2 modules went far too fast.  A lot of important material was packed in a small space.,Nope,I liked the size this term as opposed to last term (I took the class again).  There's some sort of ventilation noise that Dave always had to talk over but he was never hard to hear.

I think Dave did a fantastic job teaching the course.,The first couple of modules are pretty straightforward.  Not too complicated once the assignments are finished.,The modules after the midterm become a lot more complicated.,Great positive atmosphere.,"Dave is so far my favourite prof in Waterloo.  I would for sure take cs116 if Dave was the prof.  Dave is hilarious, and definitely makes learning about CS very interesting.  Thanks for everything Dave!"
