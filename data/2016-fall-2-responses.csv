1,,3,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,3,,3,,3,,Teach the basic C with some good practices very well:),,Overall a very structured and well-taught course. Dave has a good sense of humor:) This is my favorite course of this semester.,"I feel like we should teach students how to compile their C program on their own computer and some basic unix command during the first lecture...[nl]By the way... Personally, I use some unix shortcuts on keyboard(such as Ctrl+E goes to the end of line) But Seashell uses Ctrl+E as running test... It becomes very inconvenient when I really just want to move to the end of line...",,"Drink more water and less coke Dave, it's good for your health:)"

1,,3,,1,,1,,1,,6,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,5,,3,,3,,3,,Dave is super passionate about teaching and computer science and it makes us get excited about the course too! He has taken a lot of hard concepts and really broken them down to smaller concepts.,Good teaching style. I enjoy the use of blackboard later on in the course. I would've liked more black board rather than sometimes drawing on the slide since it's within notes and kind of distracting.,Taught a lot of useful concepts that are great for foundation & beginner interview questions.,None really.,"Sometimes if I didn't understand something, felt like I was the only one since peopl who did Understsnd would raise their hand and ask even more in depth questions.",Great class !! :)

(If I recall) the textbook used a different notation for things, which hindered it's effectiveness.",4,,4,"I think the course work was ramped up near the end, but definitely doable.",3,"Dave had said that in order to do the assignments we needed to understand and master the content from the lectures. From assignments 1-7 I found the assignments were doable without looking at the notes. Assignments 8-10 heavily required that. If the aim is to have the mastery of the course notes, maybe beef up the assignments 1-7.",He tries to engage the class with discussion and jokes. It's good. Also the taco bell and cooking analogy where you compare cooking with a recipe and without a recipe when given the ingredients was a super underrated analogy.,"I found that sometimes the slides were changed mid-way in the course. This meant the paper course notes were not the same as the slides, and some of the information on those newer slides I really liked.",The course is well structured. The tutorials are great (despite low attendance) and the lectures are usually pretty good.,"The weakest points I found were the strings. I found that the topic was so integral on the assignments (arrays of them, etc.) but I felt the proportion of time spent on them was significantly smaller than other important topics like pointers. (Which understandably are important and confusing which is why so much time was put into them)[nl]Also, sometimes the tutorials are a bit slow in uploading the powerpoints and the solutions to their respective sites.",,

I like that you make the course entertaining with jokes. It was really awesome that you drew on the slides with highlighters and stuff. You always try to make sure everyone understands the material rather than just regurgitates it and that's really valuable in an introductory course like this one. You're almost up to date with all of the relatable memes so keep it up,assign your joke references as pre-readings so we can understand your old jokes in class,The right amount of new material with the right amount of challenge in the assignments,"Sometimes the assignment questions were challenging enough, but the amount of problems was just way too long.

I never really cared for the movie but I think some people might have. The slides are great and it's great that the exact copy of the lecture notes that are in the slides.

1,,3,,2,,3,,1,,6,,2,,1,,1,,2,,2,,3,,3,,3,,2,,Making the lectures interesting.,For the assignments make the students test their own code. I got into the habit of just writing the whole assignment on seashell and just using the provided tests at the end and praying it worked. And I also doubt many students went above the simple tests to check edge cases. Other then that I really enjoyed enjoyed the course and Dave's teaching method :),,,,
1,,3,I felt as though certain topics were rushed that were important such as pointers.,2,,2,I liked the examples Dave did on the board! They were good to follow.,1,"I really liked when Dave would repeat a topic so for example he would go over an example on the board slowly and then once he was done the example, he would do a quick recap which I found very helpful just in case I missed a point in the example.",2,,2,,1,Would love to have Dave teach all of my CS courses!,1,,2,Some assignments were too difficult and long.[nl]The assignments towards the end  were long and challenging.,1,I really liked being able to follow along in the lectures on the printed notes and being able to add my own comments to the printed notes!,5,,2,Certain topics such as pointers and doubly linked lists felt a bit rushed.,2,,4,,Excellent instructor whom I wish would teach all of my CS courses. Very knowledgeable and enthusiastic in his work!,,I found CS136 to be an overall strong course and the material taught was well thought out in terms of what to teach and at what point in the term to teach it. Each topic seemed to flow to the next which I appreciated.,Felt as though pointers were a bit rushed. Explanations were good but a bit more examples of code and actually coding with pointers in class would have been helpful. The more coding examples the better![nl]I also found the midterm to be too long and certain questions too difficult and complicated for a midterm where we have a small time span to do the question. If the midterm was shorter (less questions and/or less difficult questions) I feel as though I would have had time to check my answers and code and complete all questions.,,I liked the smaller class size.
