For example, is there a general framework that we can use to think of what things we might need to test? As sometimes on the assignment I will have thought that I have tested very thoroughly but handmarking suggests otherwise. Another point is that I think there could have been more emphasis on how to work through problems more quickly as I felt that was a disconnect between the assignments and midterm. The assignments didn't really prepare us for the speed that would be needed to perform well on the midterm. Maybe a practice problem set could have helped to better prepare us for the type of question found on the midterm, rather than just looking over the assignments again.",,,Nothing in particular.,,,Nothing in particular.

Dave also gives us lots of chance to ask questions during class, which was very effective to help students resolve certain points they don't understand on the go.

The code example walk throughs especially rephrasing the code into plain English were helpful too. i could write notes besides the code so i don't have to spend too much time try read and translate a big pile of code.

Overall, Dave is amazing at explaining and demonstrating seemingly intimidating concepts.

I knew he didn't have bad intentions and it didn't personally hurt my feelings but i bet there were students unhappy about it. It wasn't a constructive or helpful comment to students, and would potentially hurt their feelings. I also don't think it's fair to call this group the ""weaker ones"" just because we're not as well trained in CS as those who are in CS major.
