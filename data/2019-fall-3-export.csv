End of term me is thinking ""man, we actually didn't really do a lot of new stuff"" despite knowing that we did, in fact, do a lot of new stuff. Maybe it's just the material sticking so well that it now feels familiar, or maybe the material was just really closely connected with the material learned from previous classes, idk.",Right amount,2,,7-10 hours,2,,,,"Great and charismatic orator, with a uniquely infective enthusiasm about the material. Dave's presentation were always engaging, and I almost never felt that there was even room to be distracted.",,,"Sometimes in class, and this may just be because of how the course is laid out, Dave would almost switch into an 'information delivery' mode and chunks of time would go by without much engagement. For most classes, there was a good balance of questions to tangents to content, but some lectures would go by where the lack of clicker questions or just a comedic and/or tangential break was really apparent. I've tutored before, and I know how difficult it is to guage a room of students sometimes, but I think a good rule of thumb might be if no questions are being asked for about 7-10 slides, then we might need a clicker question or a quick story (or at least that's how I felt at times). Again, this was rare and didn't affect the course too much, but just some parts of the material that really needed a staggered lecture (the latter half of the strings unit, and some of the pointers unit comes to mid)

Also that Coke Zero consumption rate gives me anxiety, gotta be honest.",,,"The distribution of the concepts among the assignments felt very appropriate and never too much for one assignment. The depth of the material (other than the abstract data types at the end) also felt just right: never too detailed for students of this level to know, but never shallow enough to feel like a grade 12 coding class (like some parts of 135 felt).",,,"Towards the end of the course, I felt like some of the material, specifically things like the bst and linked list functions like insert,remove, etc. were spoonfed a bit too much. I realize that I might not be in the majority of the class, and that this is a constantly changing balance to maintain, but I think it would have been a better or more thorough learning experience to implement those functions ourselves, and it would have given us a deeper understanding of how these abstract data types work.
My suggestion would be to outline the steps in the functions, perhaps with the accompanying diagrams that were already presented, but just not show the code straight up. It might be trickier to point out the common errors that students make when implementing these, but if they were given as black questions (and possibly with collaboration encouraged for them, idk) on A8 or maybe A9, I think it would bring about a more fundamental understanding of these abstract data types since those are the only concepts that I feel like I've just read on the slides and mentally copy-pasted the coding steps rather than really get down and understand the structures. I still get them, and how they work and stuff, but it didn't feel as well understood as many of the other concepts, like the stack ADT (implementing which for the first time all by ourselves was the most productive learning experience for me).
I also think the first third of the course could be sped up, but that's just my not-that-strong opinion and probably doesn't extend to the class as a whole. Overall though, great course!",,,"For the meme:
too much chinese",,,"I wonder if the IT guys ever got back to the audio issue....probably not, lol"

The other TA was always on time and got through all the material. When the tutorials did start late they were rushed and the quality of the learning experience decreased.

It would have been nice to have more Clicker questions throughout the lectures."
