,,,,,,,,,"I like the lecture.  However, it is too early in the morning."
,,,,,,,,,Interesting Presentations.
,,,,,,,,,More examples for midterm & final.
,,,,,,,,,More social with students which increases level of interest in the course.
,,,,,,,,,Needs to give more examples in the class.  Speak slower.
,,,,,,,,,The instructor has done a great job in making this course interesting.  This is my favourite course this term!  More background info. regarding the labs would help.  Maybe the instructor could have spent more time on going over the labs in the lectures.
,,,,,,,,,"The instructor is the best prof. I have this term.  I learned a lot from him, and I'm very grateful.  I really like his stories."
,,,,,,,,,The instructor teaches too fast and speaks too quickly.
,,,,,,,,,Use more examples & more help for the labs prior to the lab would be nice.
,,,,,,,,,"Very clear explanations, good pace, good content, interesting.  Cookies!"
,,,,,,,,,Very knowledgeable & enthusiastic - great instructor.  I would have preferred more time be spent in the architecture sections of the course; some of the architectural issues presented were glossed over a bit too much.
