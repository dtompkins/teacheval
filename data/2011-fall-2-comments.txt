This course was an amazing introduction to Waterloo.  I was teaching alongside an instructor "dream team": Ian, Byron, Craig and Troy. I was not expecting to be the weakest instructor. They really helped me "up my game" and rise to their level of excellence.<br><br>
It was the first time teaching a functional language course, and I struggled with the pacing and assignment difficulty a bit, but overall it was a very positive experience.
