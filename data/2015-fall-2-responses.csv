I, for one, loved the use of his high voice and low voice while explaining mutual recursion, and I like how he explains concepts in a simple manner that is easier for everyone to visualise and comprehend.","I think Dave Tompkins is the best prof there is in CS 135, and cannot think of anything I would like to see different from him.","The course introduces students to Functional Programming, which is something that the vast majority of students would have never come across before. The in-depth focus on recursion and emphasis on strengthening the basics is a very strong aspect of this course.","Sometimes there was too much expected of the students in the assignments. Also, some examples given in the lecture slides are specific to the Math faculty (in particular the example about Euclidean GCD), so that leaves students from outside the Math faculty clueless.",,The class size was large but that was understandable because many people would want to attend Dave Tompkins's lectures.

Also, the syntax and the way (chronology) of writing a piece of code (and implementing logic in the code) is so different from most of the commercial languages that it makes it harder to switch between Dr. Racket and other mainstream languages.","Yes, Dave is absolutely hilarious and it helped in a positive manner.",The class size should not be more then 50.

Thank you for a great term - you provided some much needed light-heartedness during some challenging times transitioning to university, being away from family and contemplating career paths. Know that you've had a great impact on your students."
