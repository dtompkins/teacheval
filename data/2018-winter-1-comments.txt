As always, I showed 5 minutes of a movie before each lecture.  This term the students voted for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2091256">Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie</a> (Sec 003), <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0441773">Kung Fu Panda</a> (Sec 005) and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3521164">Moana</a> (Sec 009).<br /><br />
