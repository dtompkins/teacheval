This term was originally suppsed to be a leisurely term where I was solely teaching CS 100 and I could focus on completing the videos for the course.<br /><br />

Instead, I took on three additional sections of CS 136, which significantly increased my workload. While I continued to produce a few new videos for the course, I did not complete all of the videos I had planned.<br /><br />

Unfortunately, they continued to use the same Math Faculty evaluations that they use for in-class courses.
