It was great to have the physical notes to highlight, write in, circle, etc.",No opinion,4,Lectures and course notes were all that was necessary for learning the course content,Okay,2,It was a good amount until it came to the last few modules.  I still don't quite understand arrays of strings or what some of the errors in seashell mean/why I get them. I'm hopeful that if it sits for a bit in my brain that it will click before the final though.,Okay,2,"The assignments were perfect length until the later assignments where each question had multiple parts, so an assignment with 5 questions didn't look intimidating, but once you opened the assignment files, it was a little overwhelming.  For the most part it was a good amount of work. The end-of-term crunch is where it gets a little burden-some. Dave was great with second chances and extensions though.",11-15 hours,3,"The first few weeks it was only a few hours, probably 5, but near the end, between re-reading the notes and trying to grasp the tricky concepts, and doing the lengthy assignments it was probably closer to 15+ hours","Using the coke cans to illustrate pointers was great! I am a very visual person, so having it explained in real-life terms was super helpful. Same with the memory allocation with the wall blocks. Explaining complicated concepts using simple things is extremely helpful since not all of us are CS geniuses. I can now confidently explain these things to other people too, and I'm not going to forget them anytime soon.","Give us a warning next time that Wall-e is a sad movie...
Seriously, though, this course was extremely well done. I would give up my degree if that meant I could take more CS classes with Dave. I feel confident that I can go into the real world or CS and not be a complete guppy. I am actually able to have conversations with my CS friends, and instead of calling the compiler the elves in my computer that do magical things, I know what it actually is and how the elves store memory, etc.","I finally understand how a computer stores memory and works! I never quite understood how you can write a bunch of code and it magically works, but having Dave explain it all blew my mind. If I had taken this course (with him) years ago I probably would have majored in CS and become the next Zuckerberg (or not).","The last few modules were quite difficult. That's probably more personal abilities though.
I think a little more time could have been spent on arrays of strings because they were tricky. and the concept that arrays are pointers, and then in A9 we had char*a[]. A pointer to an array? What kind of inception is this?","Besides the one kid who always asked stupid questions it was great. I think Dave always handled his questions fairly, even though we all dreaded when his hand went up. 
It was also great that a lot of the questions that were asked, Dave already had slides ready for! Obviously somebody has taught this course before (which also means that he remembers the things that students find difficult and takes that into consideration for future classes! Great job!)","Forgive my Kanye moment, but although your explanations of pointers was great, the way Rashita explained them in the pre-midterm review was awesome. It's probably the way my brain works, but the way she explained them made the metaphorical lightbulb go off.
Room size was great until the week of the midterm, when everybody decides to come to class and they sit beside you talking about the midterm and assignments and you sit there silently fuming because I came to class to learn, not hear others talk about the assignment/midterm, but finally I tell them to be quiet, and they are for a few seconds, and then they start talking again. *sigh* Students will be students."

- Wish explanation was a bit low aimed in some cases and not too high level","Quite interesting than Racket, learnt a lot of cool stuff
- loved that tutorials had a clicker component to make up for the marks lost in answering the questions wrong during lectures","- Assignments - Too long and took too long, which was okay, but I wish we were given more practice problems not for marks, but just for practice. More exam type questions so we could get more practice. I felt that the course was lacking in practice problems which would have helped students like me who aren't in Math and are doing the course after not doing Math for almost two years

- I wish there were more office hours of multiple ISAs on the day the assignments were due or one day before.

- Wish questions on piazza were answered a couple of hours before the assignments are due as well.. I noticed that nobody answers those questions :(",- Some students kept talking while the Prof was teaching which was distracting so my friend told them to shut up and it was all good.,
