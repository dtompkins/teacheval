While I understand that many students in the class have advanced knowledge, I think it would be best for their questions regarding this content to be answered outside of class.","I feel that the course served as a very good introduction to imperative programming for those new to it, as well as good review for students with prior experience.","At times, the content of the course is a little dry, despite Dave's attempts to liven the mood. I understand there is not much that can be done about this, but it is the one weakness I would note.","Dave provided a generally open and positive atmosphere in the classroom, and was generally discouraging of negative influences such as prejudice. I feel this had a positive effect on the class.","Due to the number of students from other sections who frequently joined the class, there were usually very few seats available once class began. If possible, a larger room might be recommended for future sections."

He makes jokes and funny comments that keeps the class engaged and attentive and most impressively, managing to not fall behind while doing so. Lastly, he puts on 10 minutes of a movie before class starts to encourage students to get to class early, a very effective strategy that I've never seen anyone else do before, giving students another reason (aside from clicker marks) to go to class.",1,I would not miss a Dave lecture for my life (and my money XD),1,,2,,2,,3,,2,,3,,"I feel that Dave was able to effectively teach the courses content in a timely manner, while not rushing the material and keeping the class attentive through jokes and sarcastic comments.","I feel like some lectures had a ton of clicker questions, whereas others had very few or none at all.
