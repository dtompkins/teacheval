Some of the wording was unclear, and although it may seem obvious to the instructors what was actually meant, many of us don't have the experience necessary to have this insight. This is a very, very valuable rule I find many instructors don't consider - it's obvious to them because they already know the answer, it isn't nearly as obvious to those without it. They need to put themselves int the mindset of the students to make sure everything is as clear as it should be.[nl]The clicker questions! I understand the use of the clicker questions, however, as a student registered with AccessAbility Services and going into the exam with 95% I often found myself at a loss with so little time to answer the questions. Some hid tricks that were hard to notice and some tested us on material we learned for the first time 10 seconds previously.

On top of that, he always tried to make each class entertaining, or at least engaging (the source material can be quite dull and dry if taught improperly).","I can't think of a single improvement. Dave has a solid teaching style that I wouldn't want to see changed in any way. However, there were certain times that Dave wanted to go through a lecture at a brisker pace, but was slowed down by incoming classes. Perhaps one minor change would be to leave questions until the end of lecture, or take some time (say 5-10 minutes), at the beginning of each lecture to allow students to ask questions about previous material.","Learning and working with the C programming language, from basic to advanced concepts.","The transition from Racket to C is a little awkward, especially when you consider the difference in syntax (in-fix vs. prefix).

1,3,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,2,3,4,3,3,6,"Lectures are fantastic. The examples that go along the material, however crazy, are also memorable.",,"Clicker questions and the resulting mark was done much better than CS135. Combined with the bonus from tutorials, they were much less stressful.","Tutorials were painful. The one I attended was led by someone very unfamiliar with the material  especially regarding racket. Questions from the class were generally poorly explained. Until around tutorial 9, there was no C coded and run in class. Multiple times we got to clicker questions that he didn't know or understand the answer to. Perhaps reading the slides in advance would be helpful. The only value to them were the bonus to the participation marks. Assignments were much less clear than they should be. Much too often I was asking ""What is actually meant by this?"" then needing to go to Piazza to find the answer.",,
