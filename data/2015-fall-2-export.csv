Also, the syntax and the way (chronology) of writing a piece of code (and implementing logic in the code) is so different from most of the commercial languages that it makes it harder to switch between Dr. Racket and other mainstream languages.","Class atmosphere: Yes, Dave is absolutely hilarious and it helped in a positive manner.",Other Comments: The class size should not be more then 50.

The difficulty of the course is also an incentive for students to attend lectures,Very helpful,0,"Assignment help reinforce the materials in students. It is a good idea to design comprehensive assignments which cover every week's lectures. One thing that is essential is to ensure that the instructions do not contain major ambiguity.

A difference should be given to reply in the structure and reply of 'any depths' required in problems.)",Helpful,1,,Helpful,1,"Provides extra examples, but inconsistency can be really frustrating.

Students learn less through long and clumsy assignments, only to keep modifying and guessing the code and eventually the code becomes meaningless and not understandable. I know it's hard to keep the assignments short, and what I can think of to do are two ways: (1) keep separate parts relevant (but may not be dependent), like in Assignment 9, so the flow seems very logical for students. (2) improve clarity in instructions so that students spend less time understanding the questions. (3) remove redundant parts of questions.",11-15 hours,3,,"What instructor has done well: A miraculous teacher with the ability and desire to teach.

Keep students with every level of CS knowledge interested and challenged.,Course's weak points: It would be really difficult for less-able students to keep up with lectures or catch up while advancing into hard contents in such a fast pace.,Class atmosphere: No.,Other Comments: Class size is suitable.

Must have been tiring to keep up, but nonetheless helped me to remember the concept much better. Explanations were easy to understand, for people who had a good foundation in CS and those who had never taken the subject before. Overall, Prof Tompkins was an awesome instructor! Thank you for a great term - you provided some much needed light-heartedness during some challenging times transitioning to university, being away from family and contemplating career paths. Know that you've had a great impact on your students."
