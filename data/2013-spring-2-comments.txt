This term I was primarily focused on redesigning CS 136, and so I made very few adjustments to CS 350.  This was my third term teaching the course and I was very comfortable with the material.  I did work on adding a lot of new metaphors and analogies, but I think I may have gone a bit overboard.  It is worth noting that this is the first term that I appeared in <a href="profquotes/">profQUOTES</a>.
