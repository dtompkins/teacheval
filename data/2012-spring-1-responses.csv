Isn't afraid to shoot down smart-ass questions -- a required trait in CS profs.,"Honestly, nothing.",Very fair overall in terms of workload and exam questions.  Course is detailed enough that busy work and tricky exam questions are not needed.,Course load is a bit high for summer term (I think we had one less week of lecture time).,,"Wish people wouldn't eat in class, but that's not really Dave's fault at all."

Good, animated analogies, explanations.  Fun atmosphere.","Time permitting, give more specific deeper explanations.  Course notes just asserts stuff.",Really really important material fairly well taught.  Assignments were illustrative.,"No assignments for later sections at all.  Perhaps small written assignment?  Time permitting, more explanation of OS concepts.","Such fun atmosphere, at least for morning class.",
1,2,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,2,5,2,1,3,,The instructor does an excellent job of relating the course material to real life.  He employs good analogies as well.  His teaching philosophy is well thought-out.,,,"The assignments are too long.  Fewer, shorter assignments would be much better.",The instructor has a positive attitude.,
1,4,2,1,2,6,3,2,1,1,1,4,4,3,3,,The professor understood the learning process and was able to structure his lectures so that the instructed content was very clear.,"Lectures would be more interesting if they were less spoon-fed and more thought provoking, i.e.: more asking questions.",Lots of hands on coding experience.,Lots of the lecture material were things that could be considered common sense if you thought long enough about it.,Class was fine.,Room was fine.

A diagram of OS/161's structure and what is/what isn't implemented would have helped a lot.","The assignments should all be shifted one week earlier.  The start of the course was slow, the end was rushed.",
1,3,1,2,1,3,2,1,1,3,5,5,3,2,5,,Excellent prof.,More office hours would be nice.,Good mix of theory and practice.,I felt that wading through the given code was not directly relevant to the concepts taught in class even though it does prepare us for programming in groups.  I think that it might be nice to split the course into two with one focusing more on theory and the other on practice and students can pick either to satisfy core requirements.,,A better way of finding partners is needing.  People lie about their work ethic.
1,3,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,5,3,3,3,,"Explains concepts really well, using personal experiences (Thrashing).

His use of metaphors to explain content was very helpful in understanding the material.  his pre-lecture videos and funny comments ensured I showed up for every class.,"Dave's expectations are set a little too high, which can be seen through the challenging midterm.  his explanations are sometimes (rarely) set too high, and sometimes moves too fast.",,,,
