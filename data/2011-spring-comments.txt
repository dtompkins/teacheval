This offering was very humbling for me. I hope I can look back at this course as my worst offering ever.  It was a "wake-up call" and really helped me prepare for my Waterloo position.
<ul>
<li>The course had just changed, and the notes I was starting with had been modified to be "Just In Time (JIT)" by the previous prof. (Steve) and I quickly realized that it just did not work for me with the accelerated summer pacing and  longer lectures, so I had to make a lot of changes.
<li>The labs were still in transition, but we had weekly team meetings and went through the labs together: it was probably the best component of the course.
<li>I had trouble setting an appropriate difficulty level for some components (e.g., the first midterm).
<li>I underestimated the assignment portion of the course, and they were really mismanaged.  With the summer pacing, students weren't given enough time to work on them, and they were often handed back too late for any formative feedback.
<li>While teaching this course I was also struggling with work/life balance, as I was also packing/preparing for my move to Waterloo, buying a house and planning my wedding.
