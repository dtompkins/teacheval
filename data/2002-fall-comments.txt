This was a tough semester for me.  I was originally told that I would not be teaching, and I only found out I would be teaching a few weeks before classes were to begin.  The original plan was to upgrade the PCs in the lab and use the old C3x DSP boards and software for one more year -- but when this became infeasible new C6x boards had to be ordered -- and the lab wasn't ready for use until October.  I had to adjust the lecture material and re-design the labs for 'C' and the C6x.  Unfortunately, many of the lab designs were completed at the last minute which caused some problems and annoyed many students.  Given the circumstances, I think the course went well, but it could have been a lot better.
