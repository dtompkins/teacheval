After my previous experience with 490, where I relied heavily on the flawed textbook, I spent several months researching and reading several textbooks.  I finally selected an MBA textbook (Pearlson) that wasn't perfect, but it was a good read and had enough breadth to carry the course.<br><br>
This was my first experiment with a truly "flipped" classroom.  Each week they had to read a chapter, and then I had a quiz on the chapter material at the start of class on Tuesday (using clickers).  I quickly realized that I needed to include some very specific details of the chapter in the quizzes to avoid students from being able to guess the answers.  We would then have a list of discussion topics and have a very open and free-flowing discussion in class.  For some of the chapters I strained to extend the material and discussion to the Thursday lecture, so by the end of the course I was introducing different material on Thursdays.  Overall, I think the students were very happy with the experience, mostly because it was so different than all of their other courses.<br><br>
