This was now the <i>fourth</i> time I was teaching CS 135 and my lectures were incrementally getting better.
Unfortunately, I was the only faculty member teaching the course and there was only one other instructor who had taught the course before.
Fortunately, the term went well.
My only regret is that I wasn't more involved in the design of some of the assignments.

I continued my popular tradition of showing 5 minutes of a movie before each lecture.  This term the students voted for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357">The Lion King</a> (Sec 001) and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357">The Lego Movie</a> (Sec 005).
