This has prepared me very",50% of weight on the final exam is too much,1) stick to the schedule you set out in the beginning - do not be soft on students. 2) more videos would really help learn some of the excel and html material - (I already knew excel as I have completed 4 co-op terms but  it is relatively difficult to grasp for a first year student or someone who is not familiar with excel) 3) lecture materials need to be easily download-able and consistent - i.e. if you use pdf for a module all other modules should also be pdf.

Grading of assignments also did not include any feedback, so when arbitrary marks were removed I did not know what I need to improve on.",advance  at their own pace.  There were so many errors in the tests that marks were not accurate representations of knowledge. Many questions were marked wrong because the error on the test was thought to be the error in the question.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,Effective slides and lessons for each topic,"course website is horrific. Can not study ahead because modules are released weekly instead of at the beginning. website is difficult to navigate. additionally, more than one module was not incorporated into the course overall. It feels like the course flies by the seat of it's pants which is annoying. Can not view results of quizzes or assignments.",Fix the website to make it more user friendly. It's incredibly ironic that a CS 101 course has a horribly designed
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,Everything was well organized as an online course. I enjoyed using Excel as it helped me with real life. Concise and good beginning to computer science overall.,Did not get any feedback for assignments and I was not sure where I lost marks. Sometimes it is hard to find answers to questions in the discussion board.,"For contents such as those pertaining to Excell for example, provide outside sources that students can refer to for further examples on the more complex contents."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,generally interesting and useful subject matter; clear writing.,Feedback  on assignments or quizzes would be helpful rather than just getting a mark. The course is a little tough for people with no computer background,Give feedback on assignments. Let students know where they lost marks.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,Great course for beginners in computer,"-Found that the course started off strong but ended weak. the modules became  a bit less detailed and I Found myself having to access other websites and sources to learn how to complete certain tasks. In addition, the exam is four days away and the format is yet to be released, knowing this information would be helpful In preparing.",I believe that perhaps more practice questions in the page coding would be benificial. Some  instructional videos would be nice.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,"great examples, made it fun and interesting to learn. Clarity and Variety",Fr the excel modules there needs to be more information on the embedded  IF functions. Also for the HTML there should be more examples of padding/margins.,i guess holding a physically presence lecture would be really helpful. More diagrams for multiple choice
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,Great explanations of processes (especially in the first few modules). Having the 7 late days penalty free is very helpful and reduces some stress.,"gives poor feedbacks on quizzes. If students could not get right answers for what they got worng, how they can learn from their mistakes????",I think   the current teaching of the course is fair andd works

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,guidence rather then emailing the instructor privately,"have been given. Courses are set to meet objectives of overall program - it is not set to meet student's excuses. Content within the modules, instructions are somewhat ambiguous",If the instructor could upload online lecture videos that would help clrify some of the more difficult chapters (such as HTML or excel) that would be helpful for the future.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,Having all material in one place that can be accessed anywhere at anytime.,I do not understand how so many mistakes can be posted regarding the assignments and the quizzes. It's unacceptable that a university course could have this many errors when I am paying my hard earned money to be enrolled in this course. I am not impressed,-improve clarity of modules dealing with spreadsheets and coding
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,I can learn at my own pace and all the information is very well structured. chapters that werent heavy worded,"I dont think the modules are organized well, and most of the questions on the MC type quiz never come from it.. Also some modules are not clear and very ambiguise, but when it comes to the quizzes, they ask for too muchd detail and it doesnt make sense.",Improve the way the assignments relate to the module. Some  of the knowledge expected was something I should see in an upper level course not this one.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,it did a good job of setting out the basics of how computers worked and some basics of programming,I really didnt see any weaknesses,"In the MC, put in a comment box for assumptions made."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,It teaches Students about the importance of Computing and gives them a basic understanding of using a computer in a way to help you with your daily problems.,I should change  in the future.,"Include more excel materials, such as pivot tables. have in class sessions. once or twice a week."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,It's all online so people can go at their own pace. The Learning Aspect,"I suggest that this course should be a real class, not an online one.  Many students struggle learning information through the lengthy readings, and doing hands on activities such as the HTML, CSS,  Excel, etc made them seek other people for help, usually ending up cheating.",increase the weight of assignments or decrease the number of assignments each week
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,Learned a lot about coding websites using HTML and CSS,if you aren't good at using your time then it will be hard,Instructional videos on how to go forth with the assignments
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,"material is generally easy to grasp, modules were clear and informative",Individual feeback was lacking,It would be better to clarify instructions through a course annoucement or e-mail instead of through the discussion board. Some  things are missed because it is not easy to navigate the discussion board for each assignment.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,Modules,instructions are unclear at times.,It would be nice if there was a more frequent drop in session on campus should we have any more questions on
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,Modules are helpful and applicable. flexible time management,irrelavent to people interested in programming and wanting to take CS minor,less content and weekly tutorials
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,-Modules were clear and organized into clear sections -Routine of 1 module each week was good because it was easy to predict and I could accomodate my schedule accordingly,"It is disorganized. Assignments aren't available on the day they should be, often an entire day late. Marking was slow and often with errors. The last few modules were either skipped or put together in one lesson. The overall learning jumped from basics to complicated in a matter of weeks.","Limit dicussion posts, send out emails for important corrections to course content, as well as be more clear with certain topics"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,no textbook limited,It is hard to meet with a human instructor,make concepts easier to understand and use examples that actually help to make the concept more clear. Reply to discussion questions quicker and explain tough contents via videos more often.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,Online,It's feedback.,Make the exam less precentage
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,Presentation of the modules.,"It's very trial and error, hard to get needed feedback. But  I guess that's how it is for an online course. Difficulty in understanding the modules sometimes. It is easier for things to be shown than read.",make the layout of the modules neater
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,"Providing knowledge with regards to a breath of concepts in computer science. It provides the fundamentals of what a computer is, an intro to logic, and methodologies in creating good and well layed out webpages. The TAs were also very helpful, and I should the TAs for this course want to TA again, I would highly recommend that they be selected again. Chat Hours were very helpful.",Just the readings dont help me learn a lot,Make the modules less wordy and more application based like w3schools.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,82%,"relatively well organized, grading was not subjective, assignment instructions were clear, course content was to the point and expectations/demands were not too high overall",Lack of example materials to supplement the modules. the content can be dry,Make the practice questions a bonus mark. Encourage students to do it rather than ignore.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,84%,Some  interesting content.,Lack of examples in certain assignments.,"Maybe like 2 attempts for the assignment portions, because half the time by the time I received information I"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85%,Straightforward,Lack of explanation; students are expected to know little things and the words used are unneccesarily complicated. Again the first 4 modules being very disengaging.,Maybe there is something else the student can do rather then just read and do the assighnment for their better
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85%,Strength would be the examples provided in notes prior to attempting the final assignment. The assignments were tricky which is good to help us during the finals examination.,"Lack of feed back on question that were wrong on the quizzes. I have no idea what I do not precisely understand. Giving us the ability to access the answers at some point, like after the final aviability date, can be highly contributive towards our learning.","Modules more relevant to the assignment , sometimes content was not pertinent or available in order to complete the assignment"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85%,Teaching about the basics of computer operations,"Lack of organization by leaders. They made too many mistakes on assignments, which cost people HOURS of trying to fix, only to find out there was no correct answer!","more clear instructions for assignments, include rubric maybe?"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85%,That the TAs are very helpful and give timely replies.,lack of understanding of context on most modules. Seem  to be a lot of spelling errors. Disorganized content,"more clear notes some stuff didn;t make sense, came from nowhere and the assignment questions didnt even correlate with notes given"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85%,The ability to apply the modules in our everyday lives.,lectures are repeated from 2009.  Please try coming up with something newer. Wish more of html/css was covered.,More examples.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85%,The assignments and the instructions for the assignment. They were very helpful.,"Modules covering excel and html became  very confusing to understand. Found they needed way more pictures with labels, or videos to clarify material.",more indepth on css
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85%,The assignments. To understand and be able to complete the assignments you have ot understand that week's content and apply it. The assignments are a useful tool to learn the content.,More pictures or visuals would have helped,More specific instructions on the HTML and CSS
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85%,The course goes over a wide variety of material. It teaches things that are very relevant and applicable in the present time.,"More resources, perhaps a textbook may be useful.","more tutorial videos, the material can get dry and become  hard to understand"

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90%,the html module,Not a lot of feedback on assignments. If  I lose a mark on Dropbox assignemnts I don't know where I lost it or what,"needed for the assignment, the deadline had passed."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90%,The html was described well interesting topics,Not allowing students to review their work or see the correct answers to the quizzes we have submitted.,"nothing other than the wording maybe on certain things update examples, videos"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90%,The information is organized clearly.,"not as much clarity in instructions sometimes as we may have wanted/needed some outdated course content (like the html unit, way too simplified)","Nothing specific, very good job at being available through email or even in person. More assignments to gain practice"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90%,The latter of the course is where it got the most engaging. The begging first 4 modules just felt like reading a bunch of nonsense and answering related questions. The remaining modules had both quizzes and actual assignments where we got to experiment and learn a whole lot more.,Not enough excel materials. not taught well,Nothing.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90%,The lessons about Excel,"not enough explanation for more difficult topics, old software (ex. you used an old excel, and I have 2016,  so most things looked totally different)",Offer more feedback on assignments.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90%,The material can be learned at the individuals pace. The technology involved.,"Nothing really specific. However, it would be nice if there was a more frequent drop in session on campus should we have any more questions on the assignment. Perhaps replace one day's Chat Hours with in-person communication. That being said, Chat Hours were very helpful.",post answers earlier. Takes a few weeks before it gets posted. Not enough information about final exam. Definatelly a minus.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90%,"the material that is being taught, it is relevant and useful in our lives. Allows us to learn the basic of Computer Science.","Online Course! Sometimes people forget about it, reminders could help but once a week or two week meetings to talk about modules between group members would help!",provide feedback on assignments
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90%,The material was for the most part easy to understand.,-Online courses are sometimes hard to communicate with the instructors as there are not always chat hours too many assignments that aren't worth very much,-provide feedback on the assignments sooner than months after they were completed
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90%,the module information was presented clearly,"organized but failed to stick to the schedule set out earlier in the course. There was a week where the course material and assignment was pushed back - which is not fair. I do realize this is a 1st year course but this does not set a good example for students because in upper years the professors are not going to be like ""oh you guys have other midterms, let me not do any course work or assignments this week."" (I am in 4B term) Students should be well aware of the calendar and plan out their studying times accordingly. The other thing I did not appreciate was that the delay was based on just few students - it should have been a vote. In any case, the option should not",Provide feedback on the assignments to know where marks were taken off. There are no video tutorials. That would really have helped
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90%,"The modules being re-written are very clear for non-computer users. Excellent use of examples, practice questions, etc. Very readable.",Replies can be unresponsive when it is significant in an online course and all learning is done by the student with the online contents.,-provide longer chat hours
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90%,The organization of modules.,Search engines module,reformat the excel and html modules. The first module for each one was fine but after that  it became  very confusing to understand the following modules.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90%,"The practical assignments that we had to do. Applied what we know in specific situations. Flexible course schedule, allowed late days",self learning sometimes is hard =p,"Return grades quicker. The wait time to get assignments back was awful. How am I supposed to improve on say, the Excel assignments, unless I get my feedback before the next one was due? I made a silly mistake in the second Excel assignment and made the same mistake in the third. If  I had known about it before the third was due I could have avoided it, but I didn't get those grades back for weeks."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90%,the practice problems and how they relate to the course material. The content and organization was good,Some  course contents and multiple choice were unclear,see above
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,95%,The presentation of obviously diffcult can complex topics which are broken down and simplified to allow people with no exposure in this field an opportuntity to understand and learn.,"Some  modules didn't explain some concepts well enough to do the assignments without additional resources. The content was extremely unorganized. Additionally, all the times an assignment or quiz would say ""go to this website and look up x"" was ridiculous. Don't quiz us on information you aren't teaching us.",Some  chapters at the end of the term dont provide enough explanations and it required me to google a lot of stuff n/a
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,99%,the real life examples helped understaned terms better. The ability to choose when to attempt an assignment It's online.,"Some  of the elements learned, were hard to understand by reading it online as it was an online course. The course lecture notes are sometimes confusing.","Some  excel content is not worth learning, as the functions are rarely used in the outside world. Teach more relevant excel info! I (thank god) have a good background in Excel. However, some of my friends do not, and they struggled as a result (and at the end of the day, are learning functions that aren't really used in many typical jobs)."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,100%,the strengths of this course is the layout of the course. only haveing one assignment a week with the same deadline every time was really help full,Some  of the modules are not clear on what they are saying. There is a lack of depth in each segmint.,Some  material is not clear in teaching notes. Make the assignments more spread apart detailed feedbacks.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,60,The structure of the content and the instructions for completing the assignments. Excel and HTML modules,some assignments require research outside of the given modules,"Some  of the analogies used in the modules to explain very simple concepts actually made it harder to understand. In particular, the computer hardware module used several analogies that just made the module longer without adding a lot of value."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,60,The videos at the end of some modules to clarify things. And the responses in the discussion board. As well as the unlimited time for quizzes.,"some concenptions are complicated for students to understand, so I think that videos will help us understand easly.","Some  things should be taught better, particularly for HTML where it was difficult to complete the assignments. N.A"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,65,The videos that were provided at the end of some chapters that described how to use specific coading formulas were very helpful.,some features that were expected to be used in the assignments were not directly explained in the notes somtimes the modules were way too long,some quick comments on excel assignments would be appriciaited to know what to improve on. More videos with demonstrations would be useful.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,65,the well given information,some units were dry. Hard assigments,-spend a bit more time on HTML/CSS -include a bit of an introduction to programming
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,70,This course is very helpful and gives alot of knoeledge. Overall one strength are the organization of the modules. Strongly coherent to real work operations,"Sometimes course content is not relevant, simple, but takes a long time to figure out.",Take things slow with slow increases in what we're learning
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,70,"this course is very useful and help me understand the concenptions about computer,network and many softwares. The information was interesting and relevant",Sometimes the material provided was not suffieint enough to complete the assignments. The explanations in the modules were at times vague and incomprehensible.,Teach more microsoft excel functions. Include feedback with marking
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,75,Unlimited time to complete assignments. Everything was available through learn. Organized modules,sometimes very long chapters!,"the assignment. Perhaps replace one day's Chat Hours with in-person communication. That being said, Chat Hours were very helpful."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,75,unlimited time to do assignments,the confusing words that are just jargon and not needed for explanations. The material is too difficult to be taught online.,"The course was being designed as we took it, so students could not work or plan ahead.  The chat forum was horrible--there should be a way to show examples and programs to the person conducting the chat and not all the students without having to go into email. The tests were too abritrary--its nice to be able to get rid of one mark, but also not  fair that  one concept on one test was worth more than 60% of the marks."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80,"Useful for any job position that needs ti use Excel (Most of them) An easy course and not time consming good,  useful material content modules were clear and concise",The course content DID NOT match the course descriptions when I enrolled. I have very little technological knowledge and I was expecting this course to be entry level - it was definitely not. The content was not entry level and this has been an exceptionally difficult term which was unexpected. It is not okay to announce  on the first day (when classes actually begin) that the outline has changed.  I enrolled in this course based on the descriptions and outlines that were available during enrollment; this was MUCH more difficult than  it should have been.,The entire course content could have been available so students are not left waiting for modules and could
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80,Using excel and understanding the basics of how a computer works and how websites are coded. Teaches people who have absolute no knowledge of the course the basics of many concepts. Good assignments to match the required reading,The course recently got revamped and this is the first year that new course is being thought so there is still lot of work to be done in terms of organization for the course to have less confusion.,The information for some of the chapters is a bit all over the place.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80,very parctical in real world,"The course was being designed as we took it, so students could not work or plan ahead.  The chat forum was horrible--there should be a way to show examples and programs to the person conducting the chat and not all the students without having to go into email. The tests were too abritrary--its nice to be able to get rid of one mark, but also not  fair that  one concept on one test was worth more than 60% of the marks.","The later lectures on spreadsheets do not have that much information on them, more examples would have been helpful since this made the assignments a lot harder to complete."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80,Very straightforward,"The Excel section of this course was quite difficult to understand, had to watch many youtube videos as well as reading other stuff found online. Still find it difficult.",The modules could be put on earlier so students can have access and a head start on other modules instead of waiting to recieve it after an assignment deadline. I would also recommend video tutorials/podcasts and examples posted in this course to show students what is needed to meet the assignment and course criteria.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80,Very useful,The expectation in the spreedsheet assignments was above what the content of the module contained. I felt,"The Practice questions are definately helpful since it gives a stundent exposure to the material in quesiton format. Which can help when one has to do the assignements, rather than a student having exposure to the topic in questions for the first time in a summative assessment."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80,weekly assignments,"The feedback. I wish there was feedback on all assignments because as a student, how are we able to figure out the mistakes in the formula without any kind of feedback.",The teaching of the course is fine as it is. general feedback

Had I not known about the topic prevously, the instructions would not have been clear enough on their own."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80,,There is almost no feedback. Students are unable to improve based off of what they did previously and continue to make similiar mistakes.,website/module system and so many glitches.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85,,"There's too many mistakes in the content and quizzes which makes it inconvenient to do. Also, the work load of the assignments range too much so some weeks the work load is light while other weeks it's a lot of content to complete.","well the course was online so I guess I should base ""teaching"" on the modules. Overall I thought the modules explained things clearly and creatively."
