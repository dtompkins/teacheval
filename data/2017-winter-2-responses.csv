This is because saying that ""Racket could be on the exam"" causes students to review all of Racket syntax when there will be little to none on any exam (in the case of this midterm there was none). I understand that comparing Racket and C can help students grasp imperative programming initially, and I support this.

It was hard to switch from the mentality of ""make this work"" to ""make this work efficiently"", since I wasn't looking out for it before. Also there was definitely a drastic increase in difficulty after assignment 7... perhaps make that a bit more gradual.

1,,2,,2,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,2,,1,,1,,4,,As I have told before this class was the best class I had took in my entire life whether it's about the small 5min movies or walk the moon videos and stories of little Stella(if I spell it right!)  being better than us was always the limelight of the class.,Nothing he's just a great prof and also who am I to judge a prof. who is teaching here from such a long time and also Involving the students with his jokes and humor was the best part of his teachings.,"New concepts, assignments and their efficiency requirement and the way of teaching by dave were just amazing.",The codes given in the course notes are not explained so if it was possible that there is any explanation of how the code works from step to step written on the right in the course notes then it would be really easy to study them even if you had missed a lecture.,Yup atmosphere was great.,I have always sat in the front row so I can't comment on this.
