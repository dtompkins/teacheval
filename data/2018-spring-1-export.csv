I am mostly interested in theory and learning new and exciting algorithms, which the course didn't entirely lack. There was certainly lots of interesting content as well.",Somewhat too little,3,"Being a typical student myself, I have very little discipline. I know at a post-secondary level that holding the student's hand and guiding with assigned ""homework"" is uncommon but I would have liked some of that myself haha.",7-10 hours,2,"Assignments are lengthy no lie, but rewarding and worthwhile.",,,"I am never bored in this class, I think Dave could teach me about something as boring as economics and I would still find it enjoyable.",,,"Pacing is hindered a bit by entertaining too many of the students questions. Then again i really appreciate that you aim to make sure everyone understands the material, but don't feel bad to ask a student to bring up the question with you at a later time if it doesn't seem to add too much to the lecture.",,,The lecture slides are structured unbelievably well. Very organized and I appreciate how well they filter out unnecessary details. It makes the slides very readable and realistic to get through.,,,Learning about strings and C syntax. I don't feel that most people will need to be taught that in a lecture setting. It may be more helpful to suggest resources for that material for self-learning so that more time can be spent on deeper concepts.,,,"VERY POSITIVELY. What a guy Dave is, always enforcing absolute zero-tolerance for race and gender prejudice. Couldn't be a better atmosphere.",,,The room was awful which I think Dave agrees with as he pointed it out multiple times. Sometimes nothing can be done about that. PHY 235 isn't so great.

His analogies to teach the material are very useful to actually comprehend the material and to not just blindly memorize. He explains complicated concepts in a very simple and understandable manner. ,,,,,,,,,"I feel like we didn't spend enough time on pointers, one of the hardest concepts in the course. It would have been helpful to review pointers before arrays. ",,,,,,Physics building was awful. MC would have been better.
