2,,4,,2,,2,,2,,1,,1,,2,,1,,2,,1,,1,,4,,3,,2,,Really liked the clicker questions. Even if they were not worth marks I would still come to class just to do them. Some got me thinking even more than certain assignments.,"Stop entertaining so many questions. There were two students in my class who just kept asking questions. Like at least 4-5 per class each, most of which were really silly or could be answered by just re-reading the course notes later. Also got the feeling one of them kept asking questions to ""show off"" her knowledge (eg: Student: ""ohh so x is for y"" -> Dave: ""you're 5 slides ahead of me!!!!""). Waste of time and annoying. Not that I mind questions but when it comes from the same two students every single class...Secondly, too many examples and analogies. Eg clothing pile for heap memory, etc. Would appreciate a more in-DEPTH explanation for how things worked. Analogies are only good for shallow understanding. I mean if you just think about clothing when you have to use the heap, obviously you don't understand the heap well or you could just be thinking about the heap.",Instructors very available on Piazza. Slides had all the knowledge we would be tested on. Material was logically sequenced (eg hard stuff at the end).,"Did not really think the content was very thorough on how to actually use C properly. Always felt like we were just playing around in some small artificial sandbox designed specifically to control how much we know and the features of C we use. Would also appreciate if we were taught good testing methodologies (was that taught in CS 135? Sort of I guess, not really), how to debug. The tracing tools were for the most part useless except for finding very trivial bugs such as off by one, etc. As well, this course had too much useless stuff such as the difference between the paradigms. I get that functional vs imperative is a really big difference but I think this part of the course was too drawn out. Also, not enough algorithms. Lastly, assignments were sort of boring, especially the really long ones (eg Splendor) which took a million years to understand but it was just simple programming. Would appreciate what they do in math classes which is one/two sentence problems that are difficult to solve. Most of the time I spent on CS 136 assignments was trying to decipher what the question even meant and having to constantly cross check with Piazza. One specific example is A9. Don't know why whoever wrote this assignment was not more specific on WHEN to resize/shrink. I mean yes he clarified on piazza but this is a really important aspect which should be on the assignment page itself.","Not really except when talking about ASCII Dave said something about how it was invented by ""old white guys"" which is why no foreign letters could be stored in ASCII. Got the feeling he was trying to make international students in his class comfortable? But it was weird. Just don't make reference to gender or race in class at all, ever. (btw I'm Chinese, not some offended white person). ",
