I don't think that is fair nor do I think it is worth the amount of money I had to pay for the course.,The Excel videos did not go into enough depth on the subject matter to complete the assignment. Perhaps providing additional links to external websites could help this void. I felt like I was caught in a wild goose chase looking for how to properly complete the assignment.
