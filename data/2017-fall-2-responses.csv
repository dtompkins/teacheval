1,,3,,1,,1,,1,,1,,2,,1,,1,,1,,1,,2,,3,,3,,3,,"Honestly speaking, pretty much everything. All lectures are interesting, not only because of the material but also due to Dave's presentation. He uses the right amount of jokes without impeding the effectiveness the delivery of course material. Dave is one of the best instructors I've ever had.","Overall excellent techniques/style, can't remember anything that is negatively outstanding.","Interesting language, concepts that are known to many with a background in programming yet also uniquely different (lambda, etc.)","Perhaps needs more examples of real-world applications of the code we learn. Also, the drawing questions in assignments seems a bit abrupt, certainly related but felt like we needed to learn a new concept (albeit not too difficult).","Everything was great. Dave has a great effect on the atmosphere of the classroom. Nothing negatively charged with respects to gender, race, appearance, etc. ",
1,,3,,1,,1,,1,,6,,1,,1,,1,,1,,2,,4,,3,,3,,2,,Dave is fantastic at teaching this course. The onscreen live coding is done at a great pace which is easy to follow along with. Seeing the thought process of developing the code really helps with understanding the seemingly abstract concepts in the slides. Thanks for being a fantastic prof!,,Recursion. revision. more recursion. everything's a binary tree.,,Dave is great at making everyone feel included and makes sure to emphasize the importance of women in STEM every now and then and it's great.,great class size; any bigger would make the class hard to understand.
1,,3,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,2,,4,,2,,2,,3,,Motivating an interest in Computer Science for those with no prior experience. Explaining  complex concepts using simple analogies.,None,Using racket to teach.,"Lack of material, other than assignments to practice with. Course moves too quickly in later stages, making it difficult for those without programming experience to cope.",Postively impacted by Dave's passion for teaching.,None

1,,3,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,4,,3,,2,,The professor is very good at making the dry computer science knowledge into some very interesting lessons with analogies and jokes,The instructor was great!,My professor :),A little boring in the beginning because I have learned the knowledge before,The instructor made the class a fun place to be in,Keep it up!
1,,3,,1,,2,,1,,2,,1,,1,,2,,3,,1,,3,,2,,2,,2,,"Made the class very interesting with his own interpretation of certain problems and scenarios, kept the content profesional yet engaging","Wonderful class, cannot think of anything that would be done better",Amount of online materials and resources available,Amount of guidelines or thinking process outline,Class atmosphere was light and great environment to learn in,Would prefer a room with more outlets as it was difficult to find one near each seat
