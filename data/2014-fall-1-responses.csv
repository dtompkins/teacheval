1,"Yes, having your own version of additional slides / notes will definitely help!",3,I still remember your pacman reference on explaining stepping on built-in and/or functions!,2,"Sometimes, you try to make the whole class understand the question if you think the question should be addressed to the whole class, instead of focusing on the individual as well. Unless the individual can never understand, I think you should interact with them a bit more first in this case, then address the class if you think it is necessary.",1,,1,,6,,2,"I have seen that people who learned a bit of programming before, found this course a bit boring, and for people who have never programmed before but wanted to go into Computer Science major or related, found this course challenging. Regardless, there would always be people who love this course.",1,,2,,2,I have found everything helpful except assignment 10; it would've worked perfectly as a bonus assignment especially for Peg Solitaire.,2,,2,"The textbook was a bit more helpful than the Course Notes. The Course Notes is definitely not self-explanatory in many parts, and tends to confuse a lot more especially if you try to read ahead!",3,,3,,4,,"You have done very well to make this not-so-interesting course more interesting, and help us understand the materials much better!",I think you could definitely (not troll and make everyone be confused about clickr questions) add a lot more clickr questions or examples on materials such as trees and abstract functions.,,,N/A,"The class is too packed and the lighting is very dim. Especially when you try to focus on the slide for code and whatnot, I think a bigger classroom with better lighting could definitely help."
