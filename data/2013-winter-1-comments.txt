I had been looking forward to teaching CS 136 since I arrived on campus, but this term was frustrating on several levels.  There was  a history of instability in the course, and it definitely showed.  The inherited course notes, while respectable, were far from the quality of some of the other courses and there was very little continuity from 135.  Each instructor was assigned a section to improve, but some were just too awkward.  <br><br>
The course was designed to use fixed assignments which could be handed in up to the last day of classes for partial marks.  This strained the schedule and did not allow for any solutions to be posted.  The assignments also used a token test system that created a lot of frustration for the students and staff.<br><br>
Overall, this term was far from a disaster, but the course wasn't living up to its full potential.  On a final note, this was the first semester where clickers were used in 136 (after my strong nudging).
