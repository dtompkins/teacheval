Back in school for a full semester now, I had a lot of fun with this course -- almost too much fun I think. I had a "box of fun" every week with some prop, prize or candy reward. I also had a "box of pain" for handing back midterms or reporting bad lab results. The very first lecture of the year Dave Thomas (of Wendy's fame) passed away and I had a moment of silence for him -- I continued this on throughout the year, highlighting celebrities that died every week.
