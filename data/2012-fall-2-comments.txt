This was the second time teaching CS 350, and my first alongside another instructor (Ashraf).  I will confess that teaching OS in the 8:30 section was a little rough.  This term I focused on improving the testing framework and making it easier for students to develop their own test cases.  We even had assigned some bonus questions for students to develop their own tests, which was a good success.  This term I also really focused on improving my boardwork (diagrams) in class.
