Although the majority of the feedback I received this term was positive, I was surprised with some of the negative feedback.  Most students felt the midterms were too hard, and dozens of students came to me pleading for additional marks.  Most requests for additional marks were unfounded and it seems that some of the disappointed students decided to punish me with their evaluations.  Contrary to the view of one student who felt I was marking "unfairly and randomly" I went to great lengths to be fair and consistent and I posted detailed messages on the newsgroup explaining my rubrics and how marks were determined.
