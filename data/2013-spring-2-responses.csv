1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,3,3,4,,"Knowledgeable, influential.  Gives really interesting lectures for the whole term.  He makes difficult problems easy to understand.",,Basic course that everybody should learn.,Intensive assignments but that's the way to learn.,Positively improves the quality of the classes.  Open to ask questions.,"I don't know why every time at around 9:30 when we are in the middle of our class there are people talking loudly.  Seems some class finishes earlier, but students should keep quieter."
1,3,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,2,5,3,2,4,,"Good Job!  YouTube videos.  Interesting examples that help me to learn the material better.  Friendly.  Has a smile all the time.  His baby is so cute :)  I told Dave's OS example (e.g., baker & bread) to my non-CS friend, and they want to take the course!",,Really makes me think about the OS all the time.  It's an interesting topic that I discuss with my friends.,Too much material here and there.  Could break the course into two courses to discuss each topic in detail.,,8:30 class is my favourite class!
1,2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,2,2,4,3,1,5,,"Good presentation, interesting, joking.",,,,,
1,3,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,2,1,5,2,2,4,,"Everything.  It was a pleasure being in Dave's class; engages the class, makes all of the info. Interesting.",,Very interesting.  Very different from all CS courses up until now.,It's damn hard.  I wouldn't suggest making this course easier as much as I'd say make everything up until now harder.,Excellent.  Lots of good discussion.,It was fine.
1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,5,,Everything you did in class is great!  Thank you for teaching us.,Give more hints for assignments.,,Assignments and exams are too hard.,,
1,3,1,2,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,5,3,2,4,,Used a lot of real life examples to explain lecture stuff.,Please use more graphs on the board to explain the memory stuff.,,,,
1,2,1,1,1,4,2,1,1,1,2,4,1,1,4,,Teach.,"Make the midterm easier dude.  I like you, but I would rather not see you again in this same course next term.",Interesting.,Too much work.,Positively.,Class is too damn early.
2,2,1,2,1,4,2,2,1,2,1,5,2,3,4,,"Explained otherwise difficult or confusing concepts in a clear, understandable manner.",Too few concrete examples of abstract concepts or processes.,,"A lot of material covered on the assignments was not covered or too briefly covered in class.  Explanations (i.e., in class notes) could be difficult to understand when reviewed some time after the lecture.",,
2,3,2,2,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,4,2,1,5,,Excellent oral presentation.  Very enthusiastic.  Good use of metaphors to help clarify difficult concepts.,Spend a bit more time relating concepts in the notes back to the OS/161 code.,Very interesting.  I learned a lot.,"Assignments were way too long and even though we worked in groups, the workload was difficult to split up.  Need to explain more details about the OS/161 system (tutorials perhaps?).","Very positive atmosphere, especially at 8:30 considering he has a young child.",
1,3,2,2,1,6,2,1,1,3,2,4,2,2,4,,Was really open to the class.,,,The assignments were not well explained and really vague.,,
1,2,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,4,3,3,2,,I think he did well in explaining concepts with proper & interesting examples.  Nice online videos (interesting).  Make corrections asap when he makes mistakes.,I guess more charts or examples for similar concepts will help students to understand confusing contents more effectively.,Helps me to understand how synchronization and OS works.  New & interesting concepts.,"Sometimes, it's confusing.  Takes time to understand.",It's morning class but still it works fine.,
1,3,2,2,1,3,1,1,1,5,1,3,3,3,4,,Continually demonstrated knowledge beyond the scope of the course material.,,Interesting subject.  OS/161 is a great piece of instructional code.,The lectures diverge from the assignments: feels like two separate courses.,,
1,3,1,2,1,6,3,1,1,2,2,4,1,1,4,,Gives good analogies that help clarify complicated topics.  Speaks clearly and is enthusiastic about the material.,Write more notes on the board.,Provides a good overview of what goes on behind the scenes of an OS.,The workload is too high.  I spent more time on this course than my others combined.  The lecture material doesn't provide enough information for the assignments.,,
2,3,2,2,2,3,3,2,1,2,2,5,3,2,2,,Good explanations on the content in the course note.,,,The prof is really nice but I just hate the course very much.,,
1,2,1,1,1,6,2,1,1,2,1,4,2,1,2,,,,,The lectures are not really related to assignments and midterms.,,
1,3,1,2,1,6,2,1,1,3,2,5,2,1,4,,Dave would use real life examples to explain certain concepts which helped a lot in learning.,,The course helps to get an overall understanding of the OS.,The course has too much new material so that each of them is less determined.,,
1,3,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,4,3,2,2,,"Best prof I've had in my three years in university.  He brings up interesting topics related to what we're learning, tells relevant jokes, and makes memorable analogies that help me remember things.  He is also very energetic and passionate about what he does, and cares for his students as well.","make more clear what is important to know, and possibly have a review as summary at the end of each major section (or every few topics).","Very useful in the real world (helped in interviews and in understanding how computers work), very interesting, and challenging enough to test my abilities.","Assignments were a bit hard: the instructions and hints could have been better.  Also, course notes weren't as useful for assignments.","Dave kept the atmosphere friendly.  I was happy that there was one student who kept speaking out loud, and Dave strictly told him to raise his hand to speak -- and it worked.",Thanks for doing a great job!  I wish I could've come to office hours for a chat!
1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,4,1,1,5,,"Dave was an awesome instructor.  Friendly, welcoming and always willing to help.  Also had kept the atmosphere positive and light.",He's an awesome prof!,Interesting content.,Too much new material and too much work.,"Positive, taught the course with humour and kept it interesting.","Good class size, smaller class made it easier to communicate with instructor."
3,2,1,1,1,2,2,1,1,3,2,4,1,1,5,,"Dave is one of the best profs I've had, he really understands the material thoroughly and puts in effort to make the class funny and interesting.",In the first month and half I had no idea how everything taught in class is related to each other.  They seemed like random knowledge here and there.  Doing some assignment related examples would be helpful.,Lots of information on the big picture of computer science.,"Too much work, too little guidance on the work.",,
2,3,2,2,2,6,1,2,1,2,5,5,3,1,4,,,,,"I found working in a group to be stressful, but the assigned work was too heavy to be done on one's own.  Often I felt my mark was going to be heavily dragged down by my partner's performance, and ended up doing far more effort.  I do not think it is fair to have so much of one's mark predicated on being lucky enough to have chosen an effective partner: there's no way to be totally sure beforehand.","I found it uncomfortable when the prof made degrading jokes about his weight.  As someone who is recovering from an eating disorder, it hits me personally when I hear things like that, and it makes it difficult to focus on the lecture because I became anxious!  I do not think I'm alone in feeling hurt when overweight people are devalued, even in a self-deprecating manner.",
1,3,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,2,,3,2,3,,Entertaining analogies and stories.,If anything do more demos and tell more stories.,Provides a basic understanding of how OSes work.,"Does not teach you every aspect of an operating system, e.g., bootstrapping.",,Too early.
1,3,1,2,1,2,4,1,1,2,3,4,2,1,4,,He explained course concepts really well.  He's pretty funny and entertaining which made the hour and a half lecture bearable.,Keep up the good work.,The concepts explained in the course were interesting until I had to figure out how to apply them in assignments.,"An absurd amount of work, relative to other CS courses.",,
2,5,2,3,2,6,2,3,1,2,2,5,6,6,4,,,,,,,
2,2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,3,2,2,3,,"He can introduce points by using some good examples, and easy to understand.",,Whole new thing compared to courses in front.,Hard.,,
1,3,2,1,1,6,1,1,1,2,1,5,2,1,3,,Concept explanations are done well.  Analogies are awesome.,,,,,
1,3,2,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,5,2,3,3,,"Kept lectures engaging & interesting.  Used great analogies to understand how things work.  Interactive on piazza, many profs tend to ignore piazza.",,Gave valuable information about computers that would otherwise be googled & learned from shady sources.  Provides opportunities to apply the theory-heavy concepts learned in early years.,Assignments were often a guessing game to see who can find the built-in function that fits our purpose.  Mildly annoying.,Positive.,Good.
