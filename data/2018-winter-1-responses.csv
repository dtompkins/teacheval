There was a multiple choice question on the first page, where I got everything right but the marker marked it wrong. It was clearly a marking mistake, but that policy prevented me from correcting the issue because I lost 2pts for that question. From most of the people I knew, they did not have such clear incorrect marking. I think that policy only benefited the students who were not satisfied with their grades, and prevented them from asking for a remark for something that is trivial. However, it really hurt me who just got an incorrect marking, which made me feel that the test is more like a game of luck."

Instead of giving majority of algorithms in course notes, we should have been talking more about the algorithmic approaches, and do the all implementations by ourselves. For the last two assignments I've spent more time on understanding the questions and modifying the already given implementations for the overly complex questions. I think assignments can be more real word suited examples, instead of just implementing an ADT we should also understand which ADT is more useful in which scenario and why. So that students can better understand why should someone use stack over queue or linked list over array or vice-versa. For instance, one of the assignments can be building a local social network with graphs. CS135 was better in terms of this real work suited assignments approach.",3,,"Course was engaging and clear, some of the analogies makes it better to understand the concepts.",In CS 135 we did a lot more in class coding and on paper coding these were generally good activities.

Right now it's hard to track the progress of the course since most of the time the lecture is cut off in the middle of a module, which leads to the need of extra time to review previous slides in order to proceed. It would be better if the current modules could be broken down into maybe one-lecture/two-lecture worth of material so that we could always have a fresh start at the beginning of a lecture/week. Also, with the current structure of the course note, the modules are so big that it becomes hard to give the module a descriptive name, and hence making it harder for us to truly understand what the module is about and to quickly grasp the core of each module (and to find a certain topic in the note sometimes). I believe it's an important idea in programming to ""write a function/class that only does one thing"" and I believe it's time to do the same with our course note: breaking current modules into smaller ones and giving each one a descriptive name for better performance in data retrieval (find topics in course note) and insertion (absorb the knowledge).",It is a very comprehensive introduction to computer science which covers a wide range of topics. Some topics discussed in class closely relate to the IT industry. ,The structure of the course note could be further improved.
