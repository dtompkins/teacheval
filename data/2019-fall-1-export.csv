",,,"The course required us to spend too much time on assignments to do well and that is extremely hard to do while taking other demanding courses.

The midterm was too long as writing code on paper is way different from coding on a computer with an IDE like Seashell and it does not accurately represent your programming skills/understanding of lecture.

I feel I understood the material way better than my midterm marks represent, but due to the midterm being too long I didnt do as well as I could have.",,,,,,

The main reason is that most of the gold questions are not difficult themselves once you already know the material, but they require a lot of time to figure out if you are not already proficient with the topics. That's why, more helpful hints would be useful. Also, having tutorials before the weekend would have helped me a lot. Tutorials do deepen the content seen in class. Most of the times I have been stuck in a question, the tutorial's ISA has explained very clearly the concept in another exercise, helping so to understand me such concept. ",,,Lectures are amazing.,,,"I do not think watching a movie before the class is helpful at all. Instead of watching a movie, I would prefer seeing more examples in class, delving more into the course's content and having shorter assignments. ",,,"I have learned a lot, even if learning the content for the first time can be difficult and very time-consuming.",,,"I will try to be brief: 
- Assignments are too long and time-consuming, as explained before
- Tutorials should be on Fridays just like CS115 or CS116. We would have more time to reflect on the content and would save us a lot of time for assignments
- Not enough examples. The few examples provided in the notes have been very useful to do assignments. 
- There should be either more office hours or more TA's available, for example on Mondays or Tuesdays. Office hours on Wednesdays are incredibly full.
- I learned a lot in CS115 & 116 by reading the assignments' solutions. I do not understand why full solutions are not posted. If I am stuck on a question and there is no way I can figure it out after the deadline has already passed, how am I supposed to learn? Office hours is not really an answer since they are most of the times overcrowded.
- Why do not we have any practice problems for each section just like there was in CS116? These would serve for additional practice and would help us deepen the content.
- We should have taken the midterm at least one week earlier, in order to have more time to assimilate post-midterm material.
- We should have started doing assignments earlier, so that we would have more time for Assignment 9. 
- Please, for future course offerings, do not encourage using Seashell. It gets blocked a lot of times. (I spent a whole day without being able to do some questions for assignment 6). It wasn't because there were people working on it, i.e. that day was the math semi-formal.

Assignments: I get that it is necessary to have assignments every week so that we understand the concepts better. Bu t I said this on Piazza and i'll say it again, You HAVE to give us the option of dropping at least one assignment. They take up a lot of time, and there are certain weeks when it is just not possible to complete them. SO having the option to drop one would be bless
2. Exams: I know you're against practice problems but from past CS courses, I can tell you that they do help. While studying for the midterm, I just didn't know what I should practice
3. Exam Average: You gotta start releasing that. I know the average was pretty low, maybe that's why you didn't want to release it, but it helps EVERYONE in the class understand where exactly they stand. Don't come up with rubbish like ""research suggests average don't do anything good"". 
3. Exam Pt. 2 : you cannot have such long questions like zig zag and boundary on the exam. There just isn't enough time to think. You have to give questions who's answers can be thought of within a few minutes. Also have few more theory based questions (multiple choice, predict the output) Leave code for the assignments, exams is just about testing ",,,,,,Second half of the course introduces way too much content ,,,,,,

Please! Decrease some materials or amount of work we have to do in assignments. There are some really important points that the instructor should have talked about but in fact he didn’t.

The instructor was accountable.",,,"The contents was too much, and some important points were not taught enough. For example: the instructor needs to spend more time on the “pointers to pointers” or Heap and Stack overflow, pointers to arrays, pointers to struct. etc. Since those appeared on the assignments for multiple times. If students could not understand what they should do, they will never find out what was the problem in the codes they wrote and how to debug them. There was one time that I met an error on my code which said “Heap overflow”. I asked the TA and TA and I spend a whole hour on the codes to find out which part caused the problem. And before that, I have already spent a lot of time on the question. I am not a very clever student, but I love programming and I love cs. I have other challenging courses as well, spending more than 15 hours on cs assignments and still not able to figure out is too much for me. I wish I can spend all my time on cs to solve more interesting problems, but the reality is I don’t have time. And I am not so clever to finish all the problems in 15 hours. And the consequence is that this course shows how stupid I am. My average on the assignments did not pass 50. I might fail. ",,,,,,
