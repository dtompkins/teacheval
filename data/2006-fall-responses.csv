5,5,5,5,5,A little harder questions can be taken up.  The level of questions was decent at the end of the term but was a little hopeless at the start.
1,0,1,0,0,Awesome.
3,4,2,0,3,Class interaction was very useful.
1,1,2,3,1,"- Dave has been the most helpful TA I have ever had in university.[nl]- Could work on being a bit more well-prepared when coming into class, although he knows his stuff cold. "
8,5,6,4,8,Dave is a nice guy.  He is very professional as a CS3xx level TA.
21,23,23,25,22,Dave is a very good TA.  He explained things in a clear and simple way.  The best thing is he tried to use the same wording with prof.
,,,,,"Dave is exceptionally useful in explaining concepts that were not taught properly in our first & second year.  Though a little modesty would do him well, he is highly valued nonetheless.  I wish he had taught the course."
,,,,,Dave lost patience easily at being asked a lot of questions.
,,,,,"Dave seemed to lose interest towards the end of the course.  I asked him a question about some marking he did on the midterm, but felt that he brushed me off, and did not answer my question well.  He is still more clear and straightforward than Patrice."
,,,,,Dave was a very helpful TA and helped me understand much more of the course.
,,,,,"- Did a VERY GOOD JOB.[nl]- Makes the course so much easier.[nl]- Stimulates students to think.[nl]- It'd be great if this TA becomes an instructor.[nl]- The interactive examples are great, presented material very clearly.[nl]- Keeps the student interested."
,,,,,Excellent job at TA-ing this course!  Dave is able to simplify concepts and make them very clear.  Works step by step with everyone and makes sure everyone's on the same page.  Makes the course a little less intimidating.
,,,,,Funny TA.  Hope to have you for other courses.
,,,,,Great job Dave!
,,,,,Great TA!
,,,,,"Great TA, sense of humour was outstanding.  Material was presented clearly & interestingly."
,,,,,"I don't find your tutorials too helpful because the pace is too slow.  I also don't get satisfactory solutions to the tutorial problems well explained.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for teaching.  Please be more receptive to questions regarding the marking of midterms and assignments instead of just listening and rejecting the plead for re-grading.  I think we should make better use of the tutorial times by cutting the time spent on humour and entertainment, and just focus on the work to be done."
,,,,,"I had him Monday, he was not that prepared.  He does not read / read very little of the questions."
,,,,,"I think that Dave does not understand the course material well enough to teach students in tutorials.  He also doesn't seem to put enough effort in marking assignments and midterms, since he marks quite unfairly and randomly.  He was very closed minded when students asked him to correct and fix up midterm / assignment questions that he has marked unfairly.  I think he should put more effort in becoming a good TA."
,,,,,Mark easier.  Very hard to get part marks.
,,,,,More office hours would be appreciated.
,,,,,Most tutorials are boring but Dave included participatory techniques to make them more engaging.  His sense of humour made tutorials fun.  We raze him and he razes us back.
,,,,,Nice.
,,,,,"The informality was a good contrast to Patrice's formal teaching and made it easier for material to be understood.  Sometimes hands-on examples took too long, however."
,,,,,Very good @ teaching.  Was a pleasure to be in his section.
,,,,,Very easy to understand.
,,,,,"- Went above & beyond to present difficult concepts in a light hearted, yet easily-understandable manner.[nl]- Extremely approachable[nl]- Actively involved all students in each tutorial & very effective!"
