5,5,5,5,5,Best TA I had so far
0,0,0,0,0,Best TA I ever had.  Gives the impression that he wants to teach and to be there to help students.
1,0,1,0,1,Coolest TA ever
3,0,5,2,2,"Dave is a friendly guy, good personality in tutorial.  Sometimes he does not seem to fully know the material he is teaching in tutorial, he should go to class or read up on it before hand."
13,10,9,12,14,Dave is really great TA and explains things well.  However the time of the tutorial is too late in the day which sometimes impedes going to the tutorial if you are too tired.  He is funny guy as well and can make material interesting.
26,34,29,30,27,"Dave is the best TA I ever had in my entire university life -- not just because he consumes 40+ California rolls.  He is an vivacious lecturer, and his tutorials rival Patrice's for their usefulness.  Dave has an eye for lucidity, as he knows the best ways to make students understand.  I am fortunate to have him as a TA.  He, however, should become an instructor again."
,,,,,"Dave should attend the lectures.  Many times during the tutorials he was teaching false information.  (I confirmed with Patrice).  Overall, the confusion created by his teachings decreased my understanding of the course material."
,,,,,"Dave was approachable and supplemented Patrice's lectures by emphasising concepts applicable to homework assignments, etc."
,,,,,"Dave's sense of humour made tutorials interesting.  He was also very good at managing to get input from all students in the classroom, as opposed to just the few who usually volunteer opinions or answers.  I'd definitely be happy to have Dave as a TA for some future course."
,,,,,Dave's tutorial sections never failed to be interesting and entertaining.  His clear grasp of the material makes comprehension easier for every concept he's covered.  Kudos!
,,,,,"Didn't like the fact [he] made everyone participate in tutorials.  If we know how to get the answers, we wouldn't need to go."
,,,,,- Entertaining[nl]- Usually got the point across[nl]- Style good for tutorial problems
,,,,,"- Funny guy, very intelligent and has an interesting and strong voice.[nl]- Might be better if we didn't have to wait for him to come in 2-5 minutes late each tutorial[nl]- Makes tutorials worth going to"
,,,,,Good TA
,,,,,Good.
,,,,,"Great guy! Personable, helpful, really knows his stuff and how to make the subject matter interesting."
,,,,,great job!
,,,,,"- Great TA, made the course material easier, enjoyable, and more importantly, understandable[nl]- Funny guy![nl]- explains concepts clearly[nl]- even though we go overtime in tutorials and I'm late for the next class, it's well worth it[nl]- tutorial crucial for success in course"
,,,,,"He creates an informal class environment for learning, but could make some explanation more explicit and clearer."
,,,,,"He knows his stuff, generally prepared, but not always.  Explains concepts okay.  A little arrogant, therefore unapproachable."
,,,,,"He's fast, fat, and funny."
,,,,,"I don't like being put on the spot to participate in tutorials, especially when I don't know the answer.  I prefer to just sit and listen"
,,,,,"More preparation for class might sometimes help.  Could make more effort to make students work through examples instead of just giving the answers (in some instances)  Overall, not bad but not as good as [he was] in CS 220."
,,,,,- Nicely taught tutorials[nl]- Effective at describing general ideas[nl]- specific answers to tutorial answers were never given[nl]- general ideas good but full answers should be given via web or other sources
,,,,,no answers for tutorials are posted!  Answers posted online can help students better.
,,,,,None.  Dave is extremely good at presenting material in an understandable and interesting manner.
,,,,,"Only saw Dave a couple of times, seemed fine."
,,,,,Preparation improved at successive tutorials -- Monday morning tutorial should be planned for.
,,,,,"present solutions in paper, not just scratch it on the board.  It'll be great if that could [be] done."
,,,,,Probably the best TA I've had.  Fun and teaches / explains well.  Stimulates thinking while building good rapport with students.   Helpful & easily available / involved.  Has a really interesting website (but I'm not sure about that comment on there!  Did you come up with that yourself? :p )  Thank you very much! :) Keep up the good job!
,,,,,- Provides very clear and easily understood explanations all the time.[nl]- funny and made tutorial quite fun to attend :)[nl]- A lot of communication with students
,,,,,- Should be a little more professional[nl]- show up on time[nl]- use same terminology as used in class (i.e.: skiplists!) [nl]- But - although I didn't think tutorials helped me with the class -- they were of general interest
,,,,,"sometimes goes over the material fast as if in a rush.  At least we know where the ""fast"" comes from in ""fat, fast and funny."" Will make an effective and interesting instructor one day :)"
,,,,,"Sometimes wasn't ready for tutorials, but I had him early in the week.  A great guy, who tries to help in any way he can."
,,,,,"Speak slowly.  Sometimes it's hard to follow the proof, copy the notes, think about the questions and answer the questions at the same time, so try not to pick on people to answer the questions."
,,,,,Very helpful TA
,,,,,"Way to go, Dave"
,,,,,You manage to make things fun
