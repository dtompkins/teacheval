When I arrived at Waterloo, we looked at the intersection of courses that frequently needed instructors and courses I was excited to teach, and CS 350 stood out.  Fortunately, I was able to attend Tim's lectures and complete the assignments the previous term, which helped me get a sense of the pacing, the depth of examples and the integration of the assignment and lecture content.  Overall, it was a great experience and I really enjoyed teaching the harder course material.  This was the first term I had a <a href="memes/">meme contest</a>, which was a great success.
