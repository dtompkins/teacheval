Particularly the Excel part of the course. Why would you take a screen shot of an excel page rather than just provide me with the excel page?  It made no sense made the questions undoable for me. If you notice my mark distribution, I lost most of my marks on Part B of the Excel weeks. Another point about the excel section of the course is that the functions that we were trying to solve in much of Part C for those weeks were super unnecessary and I will  never use. Why are you wasting my time on super difficult to code functions that I will  never use when I can 100000000 times easier use a calculator or mental math? My time spent on the one assignment I did horrible on probably exceeds the time spent on all of the other assignments combined. The questions were screenshots of the excel page and made me write an unusually hard code for something that I could calculate in my head within 15 seconds. Some  of the multiple choice questions were worded extremely poorly. This resulted in myself selecting the wrong answer for a few of them. Additionally, it the multiple choice was usually littered with spelling mistakes. The rest of the course other than the excel section was put together appropriately. Although it does take an extremely long time to get marks back.",all other online classes I have taken have had online lectures to listen to. just giving us the information and having to teach ourselves the information is lazy

Also, I experienced an input mark error where my mark shown in my gradesbook deviated from the dropbox mark. These experiences were extremely frustrating as I got confused with why my submitted answers were wrong and the errors had a great effect on my mark. Modules like 6, 7 and 10 were over cluttered with text and it was quite confusing to follow along sometimes.","Double check the content provided, and make some of the files user-friendly for Mac users."
10,8,7,7,12,4,8,14,12,14,9,20,,13,75%,Course materials are easy to follow.,"access to help is weak answering questions via emails is slow marking is flawed (several mistakes made with solutions) unreasonable marking in cases where there was disagreements in terms of clarity of instructions Countless. I'm in my final year of undergrad, taking my last required course for my degree, and I learned more from my multiple co-op terms at a tech company than I did taking this course. The course material was poorly written and hard to understand just by reading. The instructions for practice exercises weren't thorough and made completing the PRACTICE exercises impossible. What instructor? I experienced no interaction with the course instructor, so I had to fill out my answers above as needed. I do congratulate the TAs, as they were speedy with replies to questions and marking. But as far as online learning goes, this was the most difficult course for me to navigate through and actually comprehend. I know it must be difficult to conduct a lecture for this course, but  I found myself often wishing for an on-campus alternative where I can interact with the material (and the instructor) more directly.",Ease students into the Excel module. I found  it went from Level 1 Excel functions and then accelerated to Level 99

The topics being taught  in the course are really interesting Microsoft Excel portion of the course,any math explanations whatsoever,Ensure correct marking scheme are used when marking assignments/short answers - Train ISAs to Ensure minimal marking errors occur to students (to minimize confusion as well) - more concise text/information for the modules rather than a long clump of text

How applicable the learning is to real life,Difficult to learn the material by heart due to lack of practice.,"Excel expectations. I have worked with Excel before, but still found  it difficult to follow along in these modules. Offer more transparent and accessible on-campus alternatives. I know this might not be an option for some students, but  I often wished that there was a weekly tutorial of some sort so I could practice some of the functions taught  in this course in a collaborative learning environment with the help of TAs. I feel like many students (especially those students who are local or on-campus) might benefit from this. Offering a resubmit for some assignments. Providing the opportunity for students to resubmit their assignments with corrections might aid in the learning process - especially after a particularly difficult module."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80,"Covers alot of different material that would be helpful in real life, especially in a business setting.","During the last few weeks of the course, the material was a bit more ambiguous and the grammar of some questions of the quizzes were not easy to understand.","For weeks 10-11,  some more examples and thorough teachings of the intracacy matrix and such should be explained more in depth.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,70,Practice questions throughout the modules helped to think about the material being presented but not having answers to them mad it difficult to tell if we were on the right track.,Many of the questions were such fine points that  it was difficult to answer the question even if I did the reading.

Split the readings over the course and don over kill it by assigning the course of 50 pages for one week,  and be realistic in your expectations of what students should read. By that I mean that don't make the lecture redicously boring and add to that more boredom by reading books"

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,,The presentation of course materials are weak. A lot of the material is badly worded. The multiple choice answers to several of the questions are very subjective. When provided proof that was stated in the course material to the ISAs was still considered wrong. The answers to the multiple choice were wrong multiple times and had to ask the ISAa why answers were wrong when clearly right. Stated it was a mistake and be changed  later.,"reorganize the order of the modules. the excel weeks were by far the most difficult part of this course, and was introduced very early on in the course."

Hardly anything is taught through them, we are just instructed to read and figure it out  ourselves.","Should review the material and reread questions and course material for clarity, grammar, sentence flow, and wording.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,,very dry material. too many assignments.,Show detailed videos on how to do nested functions in Excel (to the degree of difficulty we have to show in our assignments and quizzes) Have the modules show the same difficulty as the assignments. Students often had to ask one another and use YouTube videos to explain the material even after spedning a few hours re-reading the modules.
