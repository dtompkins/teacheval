Improvements to technique or style: More funny jokes and comments because they are so good. They keep things interesting and help me stay focused during the lecture. But I understand that you are a prof and not a comedian. However you'd be a good comedian but I'm not saying you're not a good prof. A perfect professor though, if you were wondering.
Course's strong points: Racket. So cool.
Course's weak points: Huge focus on recursion over ""for loops""? There probably are great reasons but none I know of. Not enough stepper questions for practice but it was a huge chunk on midterms.
Class atmosphere: I thought it was very positively affected. The ""not-too-serious"" style that you brought kept attitudes positive and friendly.
Other Comments: The space for each student is tiny. I sit in one of the farthest rows and I can hear your voice very clearly, thank you. The class was pretty quiet except for laughter.

Having Dave Tompkins as a teacher was a blast. He consistently kept the course interesting, even when he said it would be dry. I hope to have him again next term/year, but apparently those classes fill up faster than a mall on black friday.
Course's strong points: This course is very well organized. Every teacher taught the same things, and the exams/assignments were fair for anyone in any class. There were also lots of good resources to help you if you were having trouble, something a lot of other courses lack.
Class atmosphere: Dave often made (I assume) everyone feel comfortable in class. Lots of jokes were made, and he shared a lot of relevant personal stories, allowing you to make a connection with him, which helped me pay attention more. Very good teacher.

Improvements to technique or style: I know you didn't write Assignment 9, but I feel like we would have been more prepared and less overwhelmed if we had gone through some examples of nested foldrs in class.
Course's strong points: Assignments had some humour/interesting portions (except for assignment 9)
Course's weak points: Workload is a little massive for someone with no prior CS experience. For the most part, I enjoyed the challenge but sometimes I miss having friends other than DrRacket on the weekends.
Class atmosphere: Not really, but sometimes in class I like to count how many guys there are between me and the next girl. My record is 20!

Excellent,Just Right,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Most of the time,Very interesting,Excellent,90-100%,Very helpful,Very helpful,No text required,Okay,Somewhat too much,> 15 hours,"What instructor has done well: I like how Professor Tompkins adds flavour to his lectures with several stories and analogies and quirky pop references and jokes. He is always lively in all his lectures so he is never droning on. He engages the class at most times. I, for one, loved the use of his high voice and low voice while explaining mutual recursion, and I like how he explains concepts in a simple manner that is easier for everyone to visualise and comprehend.
Improvements to technique or style: I think Dave Tompkins is the best prof there is in CS 135, and cannot think of anything I would like to see different from him.
Course's strong points: The course introduces students to Functional Programming, which is something that the vast majority of students would have never come across before. The in-depth focus on recursion and emphasis on strengthening the basics is a very strong aspect of this course.
Course's weak points: Sometimes there was too much expected of the students in the assignments. Also, some examples given in the lecture slides are specific to the Math faculty (in particular the example about Euclidean GCD), so that leaves students from outside the Math faculty clueless.
Other Comments: The class size was large but that was understandable because many people would want to attend Dave Tompkins's lectures.

Course's strong points: Good introduction to a different kind of programming language and teaching basics of CS
Course's weak points: Design Recipe - I understand the need for it however I believe it was a bit too structured in how it was required to be done. Haven taken cs courses in high-school with different 'design recipe'/templates on how things should be done I lost some marks on the first few assignments for things that seem kind of pointless.

Improvements to technique or style: He could do a couple of harder examples and go through them in the class to make it convenient to do the assignments.
Course's strong points: It's good for explaining functional programming and programming concepts in general.
Course's weak points: The level of the assignments were no where near to what was taught to us in the class or what was in the course notes. Also, the syntax and the way (chronology) of writing a piece of code (and implementing logic in the code) is so different from most of the commercial languages that it makes it harder to switch between Dr. Racket and other mainstream languages.

Course's weak points: Design recipes are a pain to write, I also believe they are not very useful when writing code.

Improvements to technique or style: Share your love in CS and teaching with your future classes!
Course's strong points: Good introduction to a very different programming environment and abstraction. Keep students with every level of CS knowledge interested and challenged.

Explanations were easy to understand, for people who had a good foundation in CS and those who had never taken the subject before. Overall, Prof Tompkins was an awesome instructor! Thank you for a great term - you provided some much needed light-heartedness during some challenging times transitioning to university, being away from family and contemplating career paths. Know that you've had a great impact on your students.
