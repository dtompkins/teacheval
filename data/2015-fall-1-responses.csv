In high school (and even in some courses now) I tended to go over the material on my own at home instead of bothering to follow the lessons, but Dave's lectures are actually helpful and engaging.

Instead of forcing the information on us, he would slightly diverge from the topic and gain our attention through light-hearted jokes or pop-culture references.
