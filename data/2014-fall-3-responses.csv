As far as class size, I think that it was acceptable, and the students were generally respectful of each other, that is, not talking very much during the lecture. The last thing I wanted to say is that sometimes my workload was such that I didn't get a chance to get much work done on the assignments before the due date (more so near the end of term), and as such, I would have found it really helpful to have an extra hour or two to finish.  I would recommend having the assignments due a midnight on the due date since they are being submitted electronically. Overall, I thought the course was well-designed, and I really enjoyed it.
