Considering this was supposed to be my last TA assignment it was nice to go out on a good note.  It was great to go back and TA a first year course again -- the last time I TA'd 121 it was really rushed in the summer and the pace was much better this term. There were 3 different instructors which made consistency a little tricky at times, but it wasn't too bad.  What was a bigger challenge was the timing of the lectures &amp; tutorials with respect to the assignments, which meant I was often teaching new material to my Friday students before I knew what their assignments would be. I put a lot of effort into my post-tutorial handouts and it was gratifying to see my notes &amp; suggestions on the "cheat sheets" students were allowed to bring into their final exam.  Overall I really enjoyed the term.
