The instructor who had taught CS 490 for several terms had recently retired, and someone else was scheduled to teach the course.  Because of some scheduling conflicts, I was assigned to the course without much advanced notice.<br><br>
While I had some IT consulting experience, I was far from an expert in the course material, and I relied heavily on the textbook.  I modelled the course structure on a fourth year special topics course I had taken and really enjoyed.  Each student group was assigned a chapter, and they were responsible for presenting the chapter, writing a report on the chapter, and facilitating a discussion around the material in the chapter.  The results were mixed.
