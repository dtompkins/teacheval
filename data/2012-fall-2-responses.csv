In previous CS courses looking at your notes helped finish assignments but for both A2 and A3, the notes were virtually useless.  You have to trudge through a mountain of mediocrely commented code and you have no aim or purpose other than 'Oh, this might be useful'.  I want to learn about how an OS works, not how to frustrate myself trudging through code.",,

1,3,2,1,1,6,1,1,1,2,2,5,2,2,2,,Dave is super interesting and really enthusiastic.  An 8:30 class depends on a good prof and Dave did not disappoint.,"Almost nothing, perhaps not let students go on tangents for so long.  It's not fair to dedicate class time on a bug maybe on 10% of students experience.",I learned a lot.  I know how a computer works so that's cool.,"I'm a math/algorithms guy, I like computers but not the kind of coding done in this course.  I wish it wasn't required but it was a great learning experience.  Quiz on day 1 killed my confidence.",It was cool.  8:30 classes are almost always calm.  YouTube videos was a nice touch.,
2,2,1,2,2,6,1,2,1,1,1,4,2,2,,,It was a pleasure to attend the lectures.  The material seems less complicated if you have an optimistic professor.,,See the connection of different aspects and how they are connected to build the operating system.  A lot of new material.,"Too much material.  We didn't cover some sections properly, not enough time.  Hard assignments.","Yes, the atmosphere was wildly improved by some jokes and the good mood of the professor.",Class size is ok.

Made it relevant.,"Less of ""It's a trap"" its early in the morning and makes my head hurt.",Deeper understanding of the complexities of an operating system.,"The assignments are daunting at times.  In assignments, a small part of the assignment can break everything and cause correct things to fail (a trivial example would be off by one errors).",,

1,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,5,3,2,5,,"Dave is great at explaining, is not intimidating, and genuinely cares for students both in office hours, lectures, and life.",Minor complaint: Diagrams would be better with descriptions.  Where 'should' you be in assignment was something other prof did.,,,Piazza environment is horrible.  You feel judged answering questions.  Alex in particular essentially says 'you made a mistake' and instructors should collectively answer questions.  My follow-ups tend to also not be answered.,"Choose partners wisely.  They will determine 90% of your happiness or 90% of your misery.  For me, unfortunately, the latter occurred."
1,3,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,5,5,3,3,3,,"Good explanations, generally helpful analogies for the more difficult concepts.",Sometimes the analogies don't work as well and a direct explanation would be preferable.,Interesting material and assignments.  Material during lectures were directly related to assignments (in the first half).  Large assignments with group work and many design considerations.,Wish there were a programming component for the last part of the lecture material.,,
