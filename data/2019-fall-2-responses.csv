I also enjoyed doing the assignments, even-though they sometimes took up the whole weekend. They really helped me apply what was being taught and were a great learning tool.","I think having a mini-lecture about how to properly test programs would have been helpful at the start of the course. For example, is there a general framework that we can use to think of what things we might need to test? As sometimes on the assignment I will have thought that I have tested very thoroughly but handmarking suggests otherwise. Another point is that I think there could have been more emphasis on how to work through problems more quickly as I felt that was a disconnect between the assignments and midterm. The assignments didn't really prepare us for the speed that would be needed to perform well on the midterm. Maybe a practice problem set could have helped to better prepare us for the type of question found on the midterm, rather than just looking over the assignments again.",Nothing in particular.,Nothing in particular.

I knew he didn't have bad intentions and it didn't personally hurt my feelings but i bet there were students unhappy about it. It wasn't a constructive or helpful comment to students, and would potentially hurt their feelings. I also don't think it's fair to call this group the ""weaker ones"" just because we're not as well trained in CS as those who are in CS major. Everyone comes into UW from different levels, some completely new to CS, and everyone has their own struggle, the comment could really ruin someone's confidence and determination.","Interesting and useful concepts, really challenged students to try and do stuff on their own to test their understanding.","The assignments were interesting but really, really, really long and sometimes a nightmare to debug even with the error message hints from Seashell.[nl][nl]Maybe the instructors could give a list of common error messages and how students commonly screw up for those errors to appear?
