The tutorials are great (despite low attendance) and the lectures are usually pretty good.,"The weakest points I found were the strings. I found that the topic was so integral on the assignments (arrays of them, etc.) but I felt the proportion of time spent on them was significantly smaller than other important topics like pointers. (Which understandably are important and confusing which is why so much time was put into them)
Also, sometimes the tutorials are a bit slow in uploading the powerpoints and the solutions to their respective sites.",,

I got into the habit of just writing the whole assignment on seashell and just using the provided tests at the end and praying it worked. And I also doubt many students went above the simple tests to check edge cases. Other then that I really enjoyed enjoyed the course and Dave's teaching method :),,,,
2016-12-05T20:03:05,Excellent,0,,Just Right,2,I felt as though certain topics were rushed that were important such as pointers.,Good,1,,Good,1,I liked the examples Dave did on the board! They were good to follow.,Excellent,0,"I really liked when Dave would repeat a topic so for example he would go over an example on the board slowly and then once he was done the example, he would do a quick recap which I found very helpful just in case I missed a point in the example.",Most of the time,1,,Interesting,1,,Excellent,0,Would love to have Dave teach all of my CS courses!,90-100%,0,,Helpful,1,"Some assignments were too difficult and long.
The assignments towards the end  were long and challenging.",Very helpful,0,I really liked being able to follow along in the lectures on the printed notes and being able to add my own comments to the printed notes!,No opinion,4,,Somewhat too much,1,Certain topics such as pointers and doubly linked lists felt a bit rushed.,Somewhat too much,1,,11-15 hours,3,,Excellent instructor whom I wish would teach all of my CS courses. Very knowledgeable and enthusiastic in his work!,,I found CS136 to be an overall strong course and the material taught was well thought out in terms of what to teach and at what point in the term to teach it. Each topic seemed to flow to the next which I appreciated.,"Felt as though pointers were a bit rushed. Explanations were good but a bit more examples of code and actually coding with pointers in class would have been helpful. The more coding examples the better!
I also found the midterm to be too long and certain questions too difficult and complicated for a midterm where we have a small time span to do the question. If the midterm was shorter (less questions and/or less difficult questions) I feel as though I would have had time to check my answers and code and complete all questions.",,I liked the smaller class size.
