This was the first time teaching the "new" 136 to the full winter cohort.  This term went much better than the previous Winter, but not quite as smoothly as I had hoped.  I introduced a new "warm up question" format for the assignments and I was happy with the change.  I got really sick half-way through the term, which unfortunately affected the quality of some of the assignments.  We were still plodding along with VirtualBox, but at the end of the term we were able to test out the new web-based GUI (Seashell).  On a fun note, before each lecture I showed 5 minutes of the Daft Punk movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8PrIzCX5mI">Interstella 5555</a>, and we were able to complete the entire movie by the end of the term.<br><br>

This was my first experience at Waterloo with on-line evaluations.  Many students (including one obvious example below) were more verbose with their comments.  While it was nice to avoid the manual data entry I had done previously, it was never a task I minded much.  I was not very happy with the format of the responses I received, which stripped out a lot of their formatting.<br><br>

<span class="footnote">Note: one student accidentally entered their MATH 136 evaluation for this course online.  The student was unable to change their evaluation, and subsequently emailed me their evaluation and comments.  As a result the (corrected) results on this website differ from the "official" results posted elsewhere.</span>
