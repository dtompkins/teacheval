5,5,5,5,5,"Dave is willing to explain things many, many times and in different ways to make us understand.  Plus, his examples can easily sink in.  Overall, he is pretty good at helping me catch up the things I didn't understand in class."
0,0,0,0,0,Dave was very cheerful and enthusiastic about the course and that combined with his wonderful sense of humour and helpfulness got me through this course better.

3,1,1,0,0,Good explanations! Could be more prepared but good on his feet anyway.
7,2,2,3,4,I feel like I can understand the TA more than the professor.
3,11,9,11,10,I think I may have learned more from Dave than from the actual lectures.  He made sure everyone understood whatever he was doing.  Very receptive to questions.  Several times stayed past end of tutorial to keep answering questions.
,,,,,Interactive examples.  Monkeys.  Subway.  Ha Ha -- VERY humourous and helpful.  He knows his stuff.  I think he'll make a very good prof! :)
,,,,,Interesting tutorials.  Good luck with the pens Dave!
,,,,,Need to be more prepare for the tutorial
,,,,,Thanks!
,,,,,"This TA seemed to have a good grasp of the theory; however, he spent much time either telling jokes or attempting to toss dead markers into a garbage can from 30 feet."
,,,,,Very funny.  Dave can always find perfect analogies for all the abstract stuff.
,,,,,Was very good at making up examples to explain things.
