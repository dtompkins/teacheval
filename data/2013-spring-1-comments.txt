This was a very stressful but rewarding term, as I was redesigning the course as we were teaching it.  After my previous experience with 136 (2013 Winter), and discussing the course with numerous people, I made a proposal to be the new course "maintainer" for 136 and to redesign it.  I think the redesign was a great success.  My co-instructors (Patrick and Olga) were very forgiving of my last-minute redesigns and very supportive throughout the course.<br><br>
In addition to the significant changes to the notes, we also changed the assignment structure to a more 'traditional' (CS 135) format with public and private test cases (no tokens), some questions were hand marked for style, and we posted solutions to some problems.  The new 'twist' I added to the assignments was known as a "second chance", where if students performed poorly on the secret tests, some of the trickier test cases were disclosed and then they were given a second chance to fix their assignments.
