I know you have a slide for all our questions, but sometimes it boosts our self-esteem to ask and answer meaningfully at appropriate times.

I feel that CS 135 should be a mixture of Racket and C, whereas CS 136 should be an introduction to algorithmic thinking, more on implementing data structures and algorithms as well as solving problems. (Upper year courses usually prove them, and they have lesser opportunities to actually implement those in a specific programming language, though I might be wrong.)[nl]- Hmm..probably a win-win situation would be to have a new section after ADTs on solving interactive problems with the knowledge that students have learnt. For example, instead of just creating functions which does just one specific job such as add_node, delete_node, etc, it could be better by introducing real life problems and get students to think which data structure should they use, and how do they use it to solve a given problem. It might be similar to interview questions? (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.) That way, on top of just learning how data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, etc, work, we actually learn what can each of these do to solve problems (applications).[nl]- Graph problems",N/A,N/A

I know I can answer the clicker questions usually, but I feel I get many wrong due to the time restraint. Could just be a personal thing.","End of the course seems interesting as we are learning applications of what we've learned prior. Before the application portion, there was a solid foundation on the skills needed. Also, I loved there being minimal racket.","Weakest point is pacing. I feel as if it goes too slow, but I'm sure people unfamiliar to coding would not want it to go faster.",Feels pretty inclusive overall.

In CS135, ISAs would just glance at the code, and tell you what was wrong, and not how to fix it. In this course, ISAs would sit with students to go through the code until it works, delaying a whole bunch of time, and even if you wanted to ask a simple one line question, it would take 3 hours, and people who had class could never use that lab. Also, just saying, most ISAs being chinese male, if anyone who was either, chinese, or female, went over to ask them question, they mostly didn't, but sometimes they ignored the lined list to answer the questions. THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER.  It would be better if the ISAs would be just glancing over at the code to say ""Oh, that's wrong"" and done, and none of these problems would've occurred.

1,,3,,1,"Answered questions well, though it was rather annoying to hear many questions throughout the term about material not in the course, as someone who is new to computer science myself. This also got us behind so maybe you could try to push those questions until the end of class.",1,"Really good visual presentation, but slides could be a bit cluttered at times with all of the drawings.",1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,3,,3,,2,"Assignments 9 and 10 were extremely demanding and time-consuming compared to the other ones. I feel that maybe the assignment deadlines should be shifted around so that we can have more than just a week to work on assignment 9, as well as assignment 10.",3,,"I always looked forward to CS class with you, Dave. You always kept class entertaining with your jokes and stories, you explained concepts and code examples really well, you were really enthusiastic and spoke very clearly, and I felt you made the course entirely accessible for all levels of experience in the class.",The only thing that I can think of is that your diagrams on the slides could get a bit cluttered/messy at times.,"The course introduced a lot of interesting material in a really logical manner, and all of the new material introduced was always backed up with lots of terminology and examples, such as why doing certain things would produce an error.","Near the end of the course, particularly with linked lists and trees, I felt that the course was going by a bit quickly and that it was hard to keep up. Even as someone who never took computer science until CS135 and CS136 in my first year, I still felt that the first half of the course could have been done faster. In addition, the constant errors and crashes that I got with Seashell were quite frustrating at times, even after repeatedly resetting it.",The class atmosphere was really positive overall and was perfectly fine.,"I felt that the class size was just right, and that having the class in STC 0040 felt really nice, compared to my CS class in MC last term. However, it was still a bit annoying when there were people that were talking in front of me throughout the lecture, who tend to be those that have had a lot of programming experience, and that made focusing on your explanations difficult at times. I also think that the course should include a component where people will know how to program and run code in C outside of Seashell, especially for beginners."

1,,3,,1,"""I have a slide for you""... but actually was very open to answering questions and gave clear answers.",1,I thought writing on the slides rather than the chalkboard worked well because the code was right there and the different colors helped.,1,"He used many great analogies to help grasp the concept, many of the times involving food so be sure to eat before class.",1,,1,,1,Dave is one of the best instructors I have had in university. It is not just because this is only my second term of school but rather I am a transfer student who already has a degree. His teaching style is extremely engaging and explanations are clear.,1,Wouldn't want to miss,1,,1,,4,,3,,3,,3,,,,"I thought the course was very well organized, I enjoyed 136 more than 135.",,,"Good room, way rather be in STC than MC."
1,,3,,1,,1,,1,,6,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,3,,3,,2,,4,,Best instructor in UWaterloo so far. Keeps it interesting. Love coming to rthis lecture.,No comments. Everything was just perfect !,Very important course for building imperative fundamentals. Interesting assignments.,None,Amazing atmosphere,Class size was good. Could've been better if Dave could teach more sections. Some of my friends were forced to attend two CS lectures per day.
