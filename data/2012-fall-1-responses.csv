1,3,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,,Dave explains concepts extremely well -- at a level that is easy to understand and in a clear and concise manner.  He's also extremely funny and keeps the course interesting!,Dave could go a little slower during some lectures.,"The course was challenging, but in a good way.  It helped me group concepts and truly understand the main points in each module.  All assignments were also a lot of fun to do!","Not a lot of proactive questions are supplied for midterm exams, which can be tough because written code is different from typed code (I'm not used to it!)",Class atmosphere was always positive.,
1,3,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,5,3,3,3,,Very fun and enjoyable lectures compared to others!,,,,Positively,Good classroom size.
1,3,1,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,5,5,6,2,4,,Dave was fun and his use of visual aids involving himself and the piece of piece of paper for fold right.,,,,,
2,3,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,3,3,3,3,,"Very good with using (humourous) analogies to understand difficult concepts.  Good with mixing up learning strategies, introducing interesting ways to teach concepts (low voice, high voice for mutual recursion)",Very hard to come up with something he could do better,Recursion was taught very well,"Different types of recursion (generative, accumulative, structural)","No prejudices to gender, race, ability or appearance that I could see.",
1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,2,,Dave is very engaging.  The way he makes students laugh makes a lot of the more difficult material more approachable.,I wouldn't want to be taught any other way.,Assignments were fair and enjoyable.,The testing process was very arduous.  I believe students should be capable of testing their programs on their own.  Marking for hard-coded tests is lame  (that's just my opinion though).,"I didn't notice any negative effects.  I'm also male, white 90+ average and attractive so I don't know if I would pick up on stuff like that.  There were jokes that Dave made about his obesity which might have been harmful.","The speaker in the room, if left on, was loud and hissy.  Room was a good size for the class."
1,3,1,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,5,5,3,3,3,,"Very good at explaining things, did a great job of providing examples during lectures to make content more easily understandable.  Made lots of jokes, which maintained a good atmosphere.",Did a good job introducing Scheme to individuals such as myself who had past programming experience -- very comprehensive.,"Pace of material was inconsistent.  First month was too slow and easy, while at the end was many times faster.  This is reflected in class average on assignments.",,"Class size was good, as was the classroom setting.  Wouldn't have been nearly as effective a learning atmosphere if it was in a lecture hall.",
2,3,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,3,3,,Keeping the class involved through jokes and examples.  Covered the material in an interesting manner.,He should offer up more varied examples when available.,"Recursion, BSTs and graphing.  The constant jests of humour.",The slower speed at the beginning of the course.,The atmosphere was affected positively by the instructor due to his occasional jokes and overall positive attitude.,This class was one of my favourites.  I always looked forward to coming to it.
1,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,5,5,3,2,3,,Very well overall.,Not enough examples with lambda / local stepper questions.  They aren't explained very well in the course notes either.,Everything (almost).,"I wished it used another language (java, c++, etc.)",Positively. Very good.,Class too small.  Every class there are people without a desk at the back.
1,3,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,3,6,3,3,,His enthusiasm made it impossible to not be interested in the material; he is a very effective speaker / teacher.,,"The assignments were interesting, but not impossible.","The choice to teach certain material didn't seem to be justified in class (ex. the difference between the 3 types of recursion, when it seemed like knowing what recursion was and being able to apply it in different ways would be enough).",,
1,3,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,2,4,3,3,4,,Everything (seriously),Nothing: everything was perfect,Recursion,,Class atmosphere was great! Dave is a really good instructor.,"Even though I'm probably going to finish with a low 70 and I'm switching into CS 116 next term because I'm not a CS major, I really enjoyed my time in CS 135, despite the extra course load, because of Dave.  He really made the course bearable and always had us well prepared for the assignments.  Keep doing your thing Dave! :)"
1,3,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,2,1,5,3,2,3,,"He made class incredibly entertaining as well as really informative, which is something that hardly happens.",Nothing: keep doing what you're doing.,I learned a lot of new interesting aspects of CS that I didn't know before.,Markus not cooperating sometimes.,Positively: he interacted super well with everybody.,"3:00 is usually my nap time, but I never fell asleep in class."
2,3,2,1,2,2,1,1,1,2,5,5,3,3,3,,Energy with which material was taught was great.,"When doing examples of what is to come in Racket they were often the most relevant examples to assignments later, but weren't always in the notes.",,,,The Indiana Jones metaphor was probably the most correct comparison I have ever heard (leap of faith)
2,3,3,2,2,3,2,2,1,2,2,4,2,2,5,,Rather engaging,Slower style of teaching,Interesting perspective: started from a point that could be related to by non-CS students,Steep learning curve and sudden introduction of very abstract concepts.,Class atmosphere was quite positive: instructor was very lively and engaging.,
1,3,1,2,1,6,1,1,4,2,2,3,2,2,3,,"I'm not even in your class, but I enjoy your teaching so much that I attend anyways.  You explain things clearly and well, and have helped me make the subject matter make sense.  Very engaging and interesting.",,,,,
1,3,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,3,3,3,2,,Engaging.,,Great introduction to CS,A bit of a steep curve,,
2,3,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,1,2,4,3,3,3,,Useful tips and side notes that really help with understanding the material and assignments.  Has a very good sense of humour.,"Maybe shift more often between the slides and the blackboard.  Sometimes, it becomes hard to pay attention past the 1 hour mark.","All the info in the course can be applied to other languages and useful, well, everywhere.","The last 3 or four sections of notes felt really rushed, while the first few chapters could have gone faster.  The clicker questions were also strange.",Positively.,
2,4,1,1,1,6,2,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,2,,Really makes the lectures fun and is able to keep my attention.  Gives good analogies of how concepts are applied in the real world.,Post the examples done in DrRacket online so we can download them.,Got challenging at the end.  Learned cool stuff in scheme.,Started off a little boring.,Positive.  No issues at all.,Do more clicker questions!
1,3,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,2,2,,3,2,2,,Great explanations and examples! Kept classes interesting and relevant.  Great job explaining lambda! I wasn't lost in the explanation.  Great examples in Racket and funny pre-class videos!,"Extra stepper problem examples for abstract list functions, etc.",Good introduction to CS,Notes: more full stepping examples (especially for abstract list functions),Great class atmosphere: very open and discussion oriented.,
1,3,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,4,3,3,3,,The instructor is a very good communicator.  The course was taught in a relaxing atmosphere.,,Learned many of the basics required to be successful in future CS courses.,Didn't enjoy how it focused more on commenting code than actually coding.,,Didn't like the classroom.  It was far too stuffy for the number of students.
2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,4,4,3,3,2,,Created visuals outside of course notes and kept class atmosphere exciting.,"More seriousness even WITH the jokes, positive attitude, etc.",Focused heavily on core points and mechanics of CS in general.,Too little time spent in areas of major difficulty for a lot of students.,"Mostly neutrally, few instances of minor discrimination.",
2,3,2,2,1,6,2,2,1,1,2,5,2,3,2,,He made the class interesting by spicing up the beginning of the class with videos that relate to the lecture.,"He could have explained some of the concepts more thoroughly.  When the results of the clicker questions disappoint, he could have tried a different way of explaining.","Interesting, new concepts, challenging.",Moved too fast.,"Positively, instructor was high energy.",Class size was a good size.
1,3,3,2,1,6,2,2,1,1,2,5,3,3,3,,I think that Dave did an excellent job of providing real world examples in order to teach new concepts effectively.,Your explanations sometimes became more advanced than we were expected to know and this lead to confusion in multiple situations.,I think the assignments were very effective at enforcing the content of the course.,"I feel as though some concepts, such as lambda stepping and tests were 'skimmed' over.",I think that the attitude and respect in the class was appropriate.,"If you sat towards the rear of the class it was difficult to see the bottom of the slides, especially on clicker questions"
1,3,1,1,1,6,2,1,1,1,1,5,3,3,2,,The lectures were funny and a pleasure to attend.  The 'clone' explanation of recursion really helped to grasp the concept.,,Almost everything.,The first few weeks were a bit boring because of my previous knowledge of computer science concepts.,The class atmosphere was always very positive and light due to the humour of the instructor.,At the back of the room I found it difficult to read the bottom of the projector screen over everyone else's heads.
1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,4,2,4,,The instructor was always very enthusiastic during class.  His visual aids were very helpful in understanding difficult concepts.  He was ALWAYS available to help when needed.  Responses to questions were great and this encouraged more questions to be asked.  Has great taste of videos and sense of humour.,The instructor was absolutely fantastic and I believe he is an ideal instructor.,"The material started at a level where everyone could understand, and the assignments were helpful.","The course notes weren't very detailed, and I wish the assignments were due on a day different from math.",Positive.  No issues at all.,PERFECT.
2,2,3,1,1,3,2,2,1,5,2,5,1,2,5,,The instructor took time to answer each relevant question and step through more difficult programs to help students think like a computer.,"For a student who has never programmed before the first three weeks of CS 135 were difficult to follow and perhaps the instructor could have spent more time building a good foundation, before showing advanced material.",The approach taken to teach recursion and binary trees.,The amount of homework expected for the third - fifth weeks.,The instructor challenged and treated each student with an equal attitude.,The class size is satisfactory.  The instructors jovial attitude made the material most interesting specifically mutual recursion.  Students sometimes used DrRacket on clicker questions but otherwise the use of clickers was helpful.
2,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,,"Always explains the concept very clear, willing to help students with their questions.  Try to catch students attention, overall made this course very enjoyable.",Could be more practical.
