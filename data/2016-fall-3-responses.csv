2,"You drink so much coke, but don't let anyone tell you that you it's terrible. You drink those because you enjoy drinking them and it is worth it.",2,"There was a bit of jump or disconnect between the work that I had to do and what I learned in lectures, but I'll leave that up to you whether it is good or bad.",2,You answered the questions the best you could even the dumb ones. Sure you misunderstood some of them but that's normal.,2,You supported the mass of slide information with the chalkboard to clarify things and that made the material easier to understand. I liked how concise it was.,2,"You presented very well for me. I did get lost at some points like with pointers but I think that's more because you had to accommodate everyone, not just me. Also I missed some classes so that would have contributed.",6,,1,Computing is the future and I am glad I can be part of it.,2,He was very good.,2,,1,"Doing homework is very useful to learning, but it's kinda hard to but assignments on your resume without a definite project.

Despite it being kind of cramped and lacking in outlets for laptops, it was a good experience to be close to the professor."
1,,3,,1,,1,,1,,2,,1,,1,,1,,1,,2,,2,,3,,2,,2,,Lectures always provide real world examples that helped to me relate to the problem more easily,Assignments seems to be based on only implementation and where interface was given. May be we can have somewhat mixture of questions where we are not only implementing functions but also trying to use those functions or may be correcting the errors in the functions. Testing a function can also be a question,There seems to be a perfect relation between all the lectures which was helpful in understanding,,,

1,,3,,1,,1,,1,,1,He was very helpful and present on Piazza,1,If I had taken this course earlier in my university career I probably would have switched into CS,1,,1,,1,"The later assignments were quite challenging due to the content learned in the last few modules. It would have been nice to have had more guidance as to what was expected instead of just the .h files, but it did a good job for preparing for the real world where you have to make it all yourself",1,"I used these religiously. It was great to have the physical notes to highlight, write in, circle, etc.",5,Lectures and course notes were all that was necessary for learning the course content,3,It was a good amount until it came to the last few modules.  I still don't quite understand arrays of strings or what some of the errors in seashell mean/why I get them. I'm hopeful that if it sits for a bit in my brain that it will click before the final though.,3,"The assignments were perfect length until the later assignments where each question had multiple parts, so an assignment with 5 questions didn't look intimidating, but once you opened the assignment files, it was a little overwhelming.  For the most part it was a good amount of work. The end-of-term crunch is where it gets a little burden-some. Dave was great with second chances and extensions though.",4,"The first few weeks it was only a few hours, probably 5, but near the end, between re-reading the notes and trying to grasp the tricky concepts, and doing the lengthy assignments it was probably closer to 15+ hours","Using the coke cans to illustrate pointers was great! I am a very visual person, so having it explained in real-life terms was super helpful. Same with the memory allocation with the wall blocks. Explaining complicated concepts using simple things is extremely helpful since not all of us are CS geniuses. I can now confidently explain these things to other people too, and I'm not going to forget them anytime soon.","Give us a warning next time that Wall-e is a sad movie...[nl]Seriously, though, this course was extremely well done. I would give up my degree if that meant I could take more CS classes with Dave. I feel confident that I can go into the real world or CS and not be a complete guppy. I am actually able to have conversations with my CS friends, and instead of calling the compiler the elves in my computer that do magical things, I know what it actually is and how the elves store memory, etc.","I finally understand how a computer stores memory and works! I never quite understood how you can write a bunch of code and it magically works, but having Dave explain it all blew my mind. If I had taken this course (with him) years ago I probably would have majored in CS and become the next Zuckerberg (or not).","The last few modules were quite difficult. That's probably more personal abilities though.[nl]I think a little more time could have been spent on arrays of strings because they were tricky. and the concept that arrays are pointers, and then in A9 we had char*a[]. A pointer to an array? What kind of inception is this?","Besides the one kid who always asked stupid questions it was great. I think Dave always handled his questions fairly, even though we all dreaded when his hand went up. [nl]It was also great that a lot of the questions that were asked, Dave already had slides ready for! Obviously somebody has taught this course before (which also means that he remembers the things that students find difficult and takes that into consideration for future classes! Great job!)","Forgive my Kanye moment, but although your explanations of pointers was great, the way Rashita explained them in the pre-midterm review was awesome. It's probably the way my brain works, but the way she explained them made the metaphorical lightbulb go off.[nl]Room size was great until the week of the midterm, when everybody decides to come to class and they sit beside you talking about the midterm and assignments and you sit there silently fuming because I came to class to learn, not hear others talk about the assignment/midterm, but finally I tell them to be quiet, and they are for a few seconds, and then they start talking again. *sigh* Students will be students."
