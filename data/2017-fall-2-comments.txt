see my comments for <a href="2017-fall-1.html">section 006</a>. <br /><br />
One student below decided to include all of the lyrics for the Taylor Swift song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V54CEElTF_U">"call it what you want"</a>. I left it in as an artistic statement.<br /><br />


<span class="footnote">Correction: there were three evaluations clearly intended for a different course.  One of the evaluations explicitly mentioned a different instructor, and the other two mentioned topics or aspects of the course that were clearly not related to this course. The evaluate administrators reported technical errors of a different nature in Fall 2017, and it is not clear if these entries were the result of a technical error or student error. I removed those evaluations from these results, so the data on this website differs from the "official" results posted elsewhere.</span>
