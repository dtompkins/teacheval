I know you have a slide for all our questions, but sometimes it boosts our self-esteem to ask and answer meaningfully at appropriate times.

This way we will have less unnecessary questions about the same thing.",,,"I think the students in our section makes the atmosphere very at ease with the jokes and whatnot, but as an instructor, you could try to seem more open and less serious during the early parts of the term.

about 5-7 hours on assignments 8 and above, especially on creating test cases.",,,I love the advanced slides!,,,Drink more water,,,A solid introduction to thinking like a programmer especially on how memory in the computer actually works.,,,"- Lack of assignments which are interactive. I feel that CS 135 should be a mixture of Racket and C, whereas CS 136 should be an introduction to algorithmic thinking, more on implementing data structures and algorithms as well as solving problems. (Upper year courses usually prove them, and they have lesser opportunities to actually implement those in a specific programming language, though I might be wrong.)
- Hmm..probably a win-win situation would be to have a new section after ADTs on solving interactive problems with the knowledge that students have learnt. For example, instead of just creating functions which does just one specific job such as add_node, delete_node, etc, it could be better by introducing real life problems and get students to think which data structure should they use, and how do they use it to solve a given problem. It might be similar to interview questions? (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.) That way, on top of just learning how data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, etc, work, we actually learn what can each of these do to solve problems (applications).

In CS135, ISAs would just glance at the code, and tell you what was wrong, and not how to fix it. In this course, ISAs would sit with students to go through the code until it works, delaying a whole bunch of time, and even if you wanted to ask a simple one line question, it would take 3 hours, and people who had class could never use that lab. Also, just saying, most ISAs being chinese male, if anyone who was either, chinese, or female, went over to ask them question, they mostly didn't, but sometimes they ignored the lined list to answer the questions. THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER.  It would be better if the ISAs would be just glancing over at the code to say ""Oh, that's wrong"" and done, and none of these problems would've occurred.
