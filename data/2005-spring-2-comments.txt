This was the first time I had TA'd a 100-level course.  It was a summer course, and so the pacing of the course was very fast... I was doing a tutorial for 4 days of the week.  I seemed to be going through a lot of whiteboard markers that were always failing, and I was often tossing them around the room and into the garbage -- I made jokes about becoming a professional whiteboard marker tosser.<br><br>
There was a lab component to the course, and near the end of the course the students were having a lot of trouble with a specific microprocessor simulator... that (quite frankly) was the Lab TA's responsibility and not mine... but I was still getting a lot of specific questions on individual microcode instructions that I couldn't answer, which is why I think my "Well Prepared" mark & comments were a little low.  Overall, I enjoyed the course and the tutorials.
