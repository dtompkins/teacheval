I had just taught CS 136 in the previous term and I had introduced numerous improvements to the notes and tutorials. In this term I was looking forward to smoothing over those changes.<br><br>

As is often the case in Winter, it was a large team (six instructors) with only one other faculty member (Tim) who was new to the course, and of the four sessionals only one had taught the course before.<br><br>

The rest of the instructor team was pretty good, but they did struggle creating some of the assignments.
Some assignments were too easy (or too hard) or were poorly specified or difficult to test (which can lead to a lot of headaches).
As team lead, I take some responsibility for these mix-ups because I didn't always successfully communicate my assignment expectations in advance and help everyone focus on the learning goals.
In the end, we were able to reshape most of the assignments and it went relatively smoothly.
It is rare that students give the feedback that assignments were "too easy", but a few did below.<br><br>

Aside from some assignment hiccups, I was very happy with the rest of the course elements (lectures, tutorials, exams, etc.)<br><br>

Once again, I showed 5 minutes of a movie right before each lecture: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2948356">Zootopia</a> (Sec 008) and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2277860  ">Finding Dory</a> (Sec 009).
