However the video component was removed halfway through the term, which was quite annoying when the transcript referenced an image that you could not see. In addition to that the transcripts were full of errors, and were difficult to read as a result, as they constantly had words striked out and extra words added. Further to this point the course material and available course resources only covered half the material we were expected to understand fort he module assignments. Furthermore assignments were described to be posted on the Monday of the week and due the next Monday (as per the syllabus), some weeks the content didn't get posted to later reducing the amount of time available to complete the assignments.

Multiple times, I emailed them because my answers for assignments did not match the answers provided. It turned out that I was correct and the answers were wrong, but instead of informing me they just reuploaded different answers, therefore wasting my time. On other times they just would not answer my questions for a week. And my third issue is that they have posted that a module has been uploaded when it has clearly not been, therefore going against the course schedule and forcing me to rework my workload. Individually none of these things are a huge deal, however after I while I felt as if the ISAs did not care to perform well in their job or aid students, and I felt like I had to berate them into being helpful at all.
