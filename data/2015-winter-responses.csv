This is to ensure the students know exactly what they have to do and know to succeed in the course.
15,7,10,21,3,18,8,3,3,8,9,4,14,12,70,Weekly assignments Chat online and walk in office hours on campus Discussion boards,Not much coding languages learned Less excel lessons Some content feels outdated (how to search),More videos Would like to learn CSS as well in this course Less textbook readings (readings not helpful)
38,38,43,37,23,36,32,34,32,35,41,19,56,33,Maybe around a 75%?,The chat rooms and the TAs contribution to assisting students with extra questions,It was my first time taking an online course and I assumed that I could work on the course every day after work (after 4:30pm) but the chats were not available after 4pm. I think help from TA's should be available after hours as well. Overall I loved the course a lot. The course was well designed and the content was very valuable (including the history part)!,The solutions for assignments were not very detailed or specific. Some only had one answer. It would have been nice to see step by step solutions for all the questions. This would help students who know the process but may have made a mistake at a certain step to spot it easily.
11,17,10,7,27,9,24,29,20,24,11,35,,20,80%,Modules are evenly spread out. The schedule allows you to work at your own pace.,The language within the modules could be simpler - I think this could optimize understanding.,"I'd recommend this course to anybody. As it is right now, it's fine."
4,6,6,4,11,5,3,2,12,1,5,5,,3,80%,"Good introduction to excel, and computer language Textbook supplements the course","The assignments tested on topics that were not covered in the lecture or textbook, especially in the spreadsheet portion of the course. This was very discouraging as a lot of extra work had to be put in to try and find the answers online or with other resources. The spreadsheet portion could have been taught better, more examples and videos would have been very helpful.",Include more videos in the lecture to show students how to work with the computer. Test only on that information that is covered in the course.
2,2,1,1,6,2,3,1,2,1,4,6,,2,85%,You learn a lot about the computer.,In the outline it doesn't explain how in depth it goes. I assumed it would teach you how to use it not all the bits and pieces that make it work.,"If not this course, then have another course made for people who just want to learn about the basic necessities in a computer not the how it works part just how to work it."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,75%,Regular assignments to reinforce knowledge,"Some knowledge needed in the assignments is not taught, and this was very frustrating at some times. Learning WikiText - I think it's a waste of time. Layout of content could be confusing and difficult to read and comprehend, given the large blocks of text. Maybe try to break them down more, and use more images and videos?",More videos! They were incredibly helpful.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,None,The course material is not taught at all. The quizzes are so general and the answers are not in the slides.,Have better slides.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,70,The easy access to TAs.,Modules were convoluted and did not cover all material required to do well on the assignments.,Update course content and be more concise in the way concepts are explained.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85%,"Good intro course to using programs such as excel, html and wiki","don't see the point in spending 5 weeks learning about search engines and how they work, rather spend more time learning about excel and the other programs that are more applicable for future use Communicating what is expected.","update the modules, a lot of it is outdated and does not match the current layout of webpages today ex. wiki modules the sidebars aren't the same as the pictures when you compare them to wikipedia"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90,Very important basics of computer skills.,The instructions for some of the assignments were somewhat vague and unclear.,"Be more clear of what is expected. Just putting the pages to extra reading was difficult to follow since there are different editions. Put chapter names, or subtitles. Also, some of the practice questions contained information not covered in the modules or textbook, and required outside resources."

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,70%,Gives you a good understanding on the different topics out there in the computing environment.,The dated content,Include more example and explanations
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85,TAs readily available to answer questions on assignments and content,"The information could be much more condensed. Doing assignments it felt like I had to hunt down specific information through excessively large paragraphs that could be shortened down. Also, for some of the assignments, how we were supposed to do certain things was not taught in the course, or just not in a clear manner. I found myself having to consult the web more often than not.","updated content as well as assignments that actually applies concepts and things that would be used in real life (ex. the coding for excel assignments are much too complex and weird to actually be used in real life). Also, some assignments required things (or functions) that weren't thoroughly taught in the content which required us to do additional searching and learning outside of the course to truly understand what to do."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85%,"Very useful information. The assignments really pushed me to learn the material in a practical way. So far this is one of the most useful courses for the working world I have taken. The teachers and ISA were also extremely helpful. I could easily read the forums and seek help there. Particularly when I emailed for help I got a very clear response right away, so I really do appreciate the support that is offered!","The format of the modules, they are not easily stated and are not always complimentary to the assignments and practice exercises. More training and videos is needed to understand the entire subject.",Make the information more concise and ensure all things we need to know for the assignments are in the modules.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90,The topics it continues to teach students about technology,"in the html, for the website one, maybe having a few of the more difficult think for use to copy wuoldd have been nice","Have more videos explaining topics, explaining excel in better detail."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80-90%,"the pretty excel assignments, all nicely laid out to help you along with out being confused where to put stuff","1) We were quized on stuff that we haven't learned. The point of the lesson is the learn, the point of the quizzes is to test our learning. The quizzes should therefore not expect things that haven't been taught. ex. one questions was (CS100 AND UWaterloo) AND Science-Students) AND (NOT CS100 OR Science-Students) However, we didn't learn and (notâ€¦). When I sent an email to the TAs asking about it they said I could look up the answer online. 2) The links to further materials and example material aren't all up to date. You can't have the students responsible for finding your errors, nor can you have us responsible for material that might not be accessible anymore 3) The textbook sections that we had to read were all done by page number. This made me wonder when on a page I was supposed to stop and what actual material I was responsible for. It would be helpful if the chapter and section headings that we are required to read were also included in the descriptions. 4) The questions to the practice questions are given only after finishing the unit (and the quiz for that unit). However, by that time I would often forget the struggles I had with certain questions. It would be more helpful if I had access to the answers all the time, so that I could do the question and then get immediate feedback. I would then be able to work through the question correctly instead of learning the false way first. 5) The entire course is taught online and the course content is all about computers. Going forward we will also be using the material electronically. However, the exam is in pen and paper. Changing the entire medium makes it more difficult for students who have just learned all the material. It would be helpful if the exam could be done online as well. (The questions would just have to me more difficult and take longer).",Please get someone to review the course and make sure that the links aren't broken.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80% if not more,Being able to play with the programs on the computer as they were taught.,Use of the textbook,"Eliminate the supplementary textbook from the course. If information is useful, place it in the modules rather than referring to the textbook"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80,The modules + questions and supplementary videos,Some questions on assignments were not alway clear and it was a guessing game to figure out what the question was specifically asking for,In each module the content was hard to determine from practice questions at times. It would be easier to have them at the end of the page or module
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85,"Helped me a lot with excel and how to use it for my required courses. As the course came to an end there were only two quizzes to complete for the assignments, which was good as required courses final assessments were at the same time.",n/a,n/a
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,n/a,There were some assignments that asked for answers that were not talked about in the modules (ex: HTML).,"The TAs take too long to respond to emails, and sometimes there aren't TAs available to replace the ones that aren't available for the online chats."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,There are lots of introductory CS concepts for beginners.,The module readings were sometimes difficult to understand. It got confusing and some things were not explain thoroughly,Relate to topics that such as social media and such. Also remove the history aspect. In place of the explain some topics more thoroughly. Eg. Boolean
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85 or higher,Teaching students how to work and use different software. Eg excel and webpage making.,Using firezilla and Kompozer to upload webpages was confusing.,More videos would be helpful to make some of the concepts more clear.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85+,The modules on using excel are very useful. The chat times are very helpful and the response to questions were clear. The videos in the modules were beneficial as they gave a visual of some of the written content.,The assignment questions asked questions that weren't covered in the lecture or textbook material. Sometimes I lost marks for things that weren't mentioned anywhere. When I would use the online chat room during the day office hours sometimes TAs weren't online or active. The course could be better for online students. There's not much flexibility in getting help for strictly online students.,"There should be more online evening sessions other than Friday night. ISA's should be able to communicate with students via Skype if both parties agree. For instance, I had a hard time understanding some concepts on Assignment 5, Jack had to explain it to me several times via. email but this was a waste of time. If I didn't get it in the notes then writing it again isn't going to help. I should be able to speak to someone on the phone or Skype to get a verbal help since I live way to far to attend office hours."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"High 80s, low 90s",The online chat room was my saving grace. Jack was an amazing ISA and he helped with understanding the material.,Assignments are very difficult for a level 1 course. Marking was harsh.,Focus more on main points in teaching and quizzes rather than trying to test insignificant memorization.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90,None,Practice exercises did not prepare us properly for the assignments (especially in the excel modules) Expectation from some modules were not clear enough,"More chat sessions, and better feedback on assignments."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,75%,The right amount of activities,Hard to keep track,mandatory weekly quizzes
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,75%,It is convenient,"feedback was okay but not enough. would like full correct solutions. ex. when building the website, have a sample that has perfect marks some information wasn't detailed enough",have samples of perfect assignments after the completion have examples for formula errors. what formula could have caused #NUM? to appear
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,"modules were organized into different componenets ex. 4.1, 4.2 able to reach instructors in a quick manner","always received incorrect feedback regarding grades, had to get corrections multiple times","instead of offering the entire week for an assignment to be late, do 2 days because this gives time for other students who hand it in on time to look over their assignments and compare it with the answers since they only have 2 weeks to dispute marks"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,87,"simple, not too detailed",Some of the material is out of date.,N/A
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80,The Excel component and HTML component contain enough information to allow for a good understanding of how to make a basic Excel sheet or website.,"Its online, and therefore, anyone who learns better listening to things is at a disadvantage. Part C questions are difficult as well.",Mark assignments a little quicker so we have more time to reflect on the feedback before doing the next assignment while the information is still fresh.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,95%,"Its organization, clarity, and ease of accessing materials to help with assignment questions. Well structured","Often, modules do not go into deep explanation. If technology is already to be used, I feel like it would have been more helpful to have videos and student-lecturer interactions VIA different social platforms rather than blocks of information in paragraph format. Also, often the feedback on assignments is quickly done in a vague format. The feedback will not help me understand what I did wrong and further enhance the probability of me fixing any future mistakes from happening on the final exam.","Implement better ways of using the technology available. Also, encourage TA's to be more available to those students who actually can be on campus to ask questions rather than those that simply solely rely on emailing."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80,The course is well dispersed to give new students a great idea what the world of computer science is all about. I enjoyed the various components of assignments that encouraged my studying of the course material.,"The quizs to unlock the answer key to the practice questions seemed very difficult and asks for too specific of an answer. Ended up wasting a lot of time on that, as I wanted to make sure I was doing everything correctly. Need to improve that in the future. I felt that some parts of the course material online were very dull to read. Make the content more appealing and improve the readability of the content.","Work on updating the text of the course content, by making it more engaging. Also, as stated above making the answer keys to the practice questions more accessible would be awesome."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85,Assignments were an accurate reflection of the material taught.,The last 3 modules were not interesting.,I don't think anything needs to be changed.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,70%,"Very useful, assignments were fun to do.","Some material that was expected to use on assignments was not explained within the modules, especially in the excel assignments. Course material was not organized well, should be broken down into more modules or sub modules. Contents was also all over the place and jumped around.",Better and more feedback on assignments.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80,The modules are very informative and helpful.,The last module should be more detailed. Feedback on assignments should be more and it should be marked faster. Also there should be solutions to all the exercises not just videos to some problems. There has to be solutions to all the exercises so we known that we are on the right track. Also upload most of the assignments and files early so people who want to get ahead can actually get ahead.,Upload everything early please. Some of us would like to get ahead and finish everything beforehand so it could work with our schedule. Also Make assignments open from the start like at least half of them.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,If I continue to study as well as I have for the course of the semester I expect to end up with an overall grade that will be over 75%.,Material that was included went into good detail and was explained well most of the time.,"- for a 100 level course, and as a complete beginner to alot of the concepts this course was very challenging at times. The concepts were sometimes not explained very well/ or broken down enough",for the excel section much more of a basic breakdown is needed for true beginners
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80+,The ability to teach a variety of things in a short period of time and in good schedule.,"-would have preffered this course to be offered on campus, in a class room setting -some marking felt unfair. (I would work hard on the assignments, then it would have no technique difficulties on my end, but when it is marked there were errors with the file on two separate occasions and marks were taken off for that. it tends to be discouraging especially when alot of time and effort was put into it.) -Because it was an online course it was hard to asks question face to face, which I like best, instead of over email.","-would have preferred this course to be offered on campus, in a class room setting. -explain more clearly the format of how assignments should be handed in and add a preventive method to prevent losing marks just from technical difficulties."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85%,-the workload is well laid out/ spread evenly -good course to be able to work at your own pace,The course seems to include many aspects that are not relevant to the main theme of the course.,More video examples on how to complete problems in module.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90%,-information explained very clearly,-could be more clear and to the point,"there was a lot of readings, maybe break them up into smaller portions for absorption"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Over 80,The online aspect of the course is convenient. The TA's are also very helpful.,"I think that if the material were taught in-class, it would be easier to understand. Or if there were online videos that taught the material instead.",Make it an in-class course
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,-Easy feedback and help through discussion boards,learning excel was not communicated effectivly. had to use other tools like mr. Excel to figure out many of the formulas,Have longer videos (and slower paced) or summary videos for each module
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80,The assignments help understand the material,more videos needed,The course modules should have a more reasonable amount of practice questions within them. It took too long to get through some modules sometimes.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85%,taught online so as to be focused on tech,The multiple choice of the assignments didn't test for knowledge; it tested very specific things that didn't help with assignments.,"update the course content, newer versions of software exists now (ex/ updated version of excel on mac/pc)"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Around 90%,"Organized, assignments were helpful","Expectations are not clearly laid out, as well as they could be.",Create video tutorials for better academic understanding
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,75%,"The assignments, because I was able to learn the content much more extensively through them.",Make all assignments available from the start so students can choose to work ahead.,set up an instant messaging tool and a time so that people who cant attend office hours can get help from where ever they are
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90%,Gives students and introduction to a variety of computer science related topics.,Excel formulas within formulas,"For HTML we were instructed to use a third party program to assist us, unknowningly we were not allowed any aids for the final and we were expected to recreated tags and or codes of HTML for our practice exams. I find that it would have been better if we weren't introduced to the third party program in the first place and learned to code HTML ourselves."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85%,"Simple, organized",i prefer inclass courses over online. Not being able to message the prof instantly was a weakness ,"The due dates for the assignments are slightly inconvenient because they were due on mondays, so if we were working on it the weekend before it was due, we wouldn't have access to any help until the monday which made completing the assignments feel rushed. Yes I understand I could have worked on them the week before, but I never really had the time to until the weekends."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85%,Wikipedia use,"Answers for assignments aren't always shown. For example Part B, the answer for the short answers are sometimes not shown. Therefore I am not allowed to understand which step of my thought process went wrong, or how I answered incorrectly.",don't expect students to know wikitext and HTML tags for the final exam. WE HAVE OTHER COURSES with lots of information that will be way more beneficial to understand and memorize
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,70%,Grace days were nice to have because during weeks where we are overwhelmed with other assignments it gives us an extra day or two to finish up. Also the information in the modules walks you through the practice problems.,There are a lot of new terms used in this course that can lead to confusion when trying to understand the material. It just takes time to become familiar with them.,More concise readings.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80%,"Overall pretty interesting material were covered, but organization of the course is lacking.",Not really sure..,remove exam
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,70%,Since this was an online course the assignment were a must to keep us on top of the material. The interactive style of the assignments got us working with excel and HTLM so we could really see how they worked. This was very helpful in demonstrating the material covered in the module.,"the fact that we are expected to memorize the HTML tags for the final exam is not something I agree with. There are so many little details that we shouldn't have to memorize but we are expected to. T understand needing to know the excel functions but HTML and wikitext is something I can't see myself using in the future which is why this aspect of the course could use some major improvements. I disagree that in order to pass the course, you must pass the final exam. This is something I have always disagreed with and it puts extra pressure on the students who also have 4 other exams to study for","The pod casts were very very very helpful. I guess students will learn better with the video lecture than the long text (Which I abhorred). There were few very unpractical modules such as how the search engine works. I think we should replace this part with basic coding or learning things that we could actually apply. I enjoyed [Excel, html, wiki-text et cetera). I think those chapters should remain. Furthermore another critique that I will like to make is about the method of testing the information. Some quiz question resembled some kind of SAT English test. It was both convoluted and I had to meditate for a long time to understand what the question was asking me. Since CS100 is an entry level course and in order to accommodate wide variety of students the complex wording should change. I spend most of the time deciphering the long text and quiz whether than spending time learning the material (Usually end up searching up in google to learn it rather than reading the module). Many thanks for reading"
