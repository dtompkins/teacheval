32,29,27,35,25,8,10,21,21,- Dave's lectures are very enjoyable[nl]- Interesting examples[nl]- More examples on mid-term (or exam) like questions are needed
,,,,,,,,,"demos.  humor.  still speaks fast, however, that's my fault."
,,,,,,,,,- Excellent effort in preparing lectures and making material interesting and exciting.[nl]- Use of props & visual tools are helpful and make attending class a treat.
,,,,,,,,,"- Excellet job relating theoretic material to real life ie: stories, examples[nl]- Great job keeping course fresh and making us more well rounded students while keeping with our geeky nature (ie: olympic medal & academy awards contest, Star Wars references, movies, pop culture in general)  Great job !!![nl]- Love that box of fun!"
,,,,,,,,,"For the type of material covered, this course was well taught.  I'm personally more used to taking courses where theory is prevalent and the material is very formal.  It was refreshing to take a course that was practical."
,,,,,,,,,"Hey, This guy is Cool!  You don't want to miss any of his class."
,,,,,,,,,He's a very interesting person.  He still goes too fast on the difficult materials.  He does make the topic interesting.
,,,,,,,,,"I thought this course was taught appropriately given that it is an applied DSP course and not a theoretical one.  However, the parts of the course that were concerned with theory were not treated very rigorously.  Maybe more examples would help?  Overall, I had fun in this course and feel I learned a lot.  Dave is a charismatic guy who appears interested in teaching, something of a rarity in this dept.  Instructor made the class fun"
,,,,,,,,,Instructor is a great guy.  He reminds me of John Belushi.
,,,,,,,,,"Instructor is funny and talks about many interesting real-life tidbits of info related to the course which makes the course seem less dry.  However, it seems as if lecture material is somewhat separate from the labs.  It would be more useful if instructor talked more about the labs on the lectures."
,,,,,,,,,Interesting props to aid lecture material.  Sometimes speaks too quickly.
,,,,,,,,,Midterm was too long
,,,,,,,,,More time should be spent on explaining labs.
,,,,,,,,,"Notes are too simplified -- need more details, especially since we don't have textbook.  Class is interesting.  Prof is entertaining."
,,,,,,,,,notes is a bit too brief
,,,,,,,,,Sometimes speaks too fast
,,,,,,,,,Speak too fast sometimes that I couldn't catch some materials.  Too few examples in some topics.  Interesting.
,,,,,,,,,"- The box of fun is a great way to encourage class participation[nl]- The course is so depressing, every week a celebrity dies![nl]- Great prof., give this man an Oscar."
,,,,,,,,,Too much talking about celebrities.  No I Lie.  Its good.  Instructor is good but not clear on some parts of course.
,,,,,,,,,very interesting class
,,,,,,,,,"- very interesting lectures, but could spend more time on discussing lab-related specific issues.  (every lab is quite chaotic for first hour...)[nl]- good slides[nl]- great attitude[nl]- ""box of fun"" is good idea; could make the box more appealing[nl]- obviously the scrumptious, delicious, melt-in-your-mouth cookies did not affect the ratings of this instructor"
,,,,,,,,,"Wasted too much time talking about movies, etc.  better if use time to explain course material in more detail."
