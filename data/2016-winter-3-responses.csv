38,29,28,37,14,43,24,18,16,20,38,15,24,30,62,a wide variety of help opportunities when needed,"Being an online course can be a positive or a negative thing depending on the person, but for me I think I would be more motivated if the material was taught in class, especially the first few units, even if it is one class per week.",change some of the content to make it more clear
64,64,67,72,52,61,66,54,63,48,65,48,62,94,29,"As a science major, I found these basic CS concepts to be very practical especially the excel formulas that were taught.","Covered too many topics in one week - did not get in depth
Some topics were unnecessary like TCP/IP",explain some of the modules a little better on how to do certain things.
14,22,21,13,33,13,23,30,28,30,12,30,29,,5,Assignments,"Difficulty of later modules. I had no prior knowledge, and was extreamly confused as modules got more complicated after module 7",Focus more on excel/word
5,5,7,1,21,4,6,3,8,1,7,12,5,,1,Assignments put learning objectives into perspective. Well laid out course.,Does not properly explain the basics of html need to google most things,"Get rid of the computer section.  If I want to take a computer course, I would have signed up for CS 115.  I wanted to learn more about Excel, and web page management.... you know, things that would be useful for getting a job.  Not sure why this is a difficult concept."
3,4,1,1,3,3,2,3,3,1,1,4,1,,0,Assignments that reflected the material being taught.,Don't offer so many late days without penalty.,Have a concrete schedule and stick to it. Give assignments 2 weeks in advance but have them overlap (so people who have a busy week can still work on the assignments and get them all done)
,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,"Assignments to enhance the material 
Pictures to relate to the material",excel,Have questions that are easier to understand.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Assignments were relevant, multiple assistants available to help answer questions.","Harder concepts (such as networks, modems, etc) more difficult to understand",I don't know. I just do not think this course is for me. Thanks.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,basic CS - good introductory,"I took this course for a basic understanding in computer technology, and though I have learnt a lot, I think that a lot of the information provided in the modules assumes that students already have some understanding for the computer programs. I found especially with the excel modules, that this was true. I have a decent background with excel, however, some of the assignments and practice questions left unclear explanations and sometimes I didn't have any idea of what formula to use or what steps to take to figure it out. 
Not all the formulas were provided to us and it was extremely difficult to figure it out on my own. Some assignments (HTML) were not given feedback, and it would have been really helpful for the following assignments to know where you went wrong before so you can actually correct for your mistakes. Linking the .css and .html was very unclear.",i hope there is more examples and videos to help understand techniques.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Basic understandings of computer functions.,"In terms of course content, I found most things to be useful, so not much weakness n the course.","I never really heard from the instructor. I understand there are TAs, but even with my previous online courses the instructors definitely made more of an appearance."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Being able to learn HTML and CSS.,instructions needs to be clear,"I really like how the class is set up, with the late days, time to do each assignment, and assignments aren't too long or hard either. So personally, I think the course is fine as it is."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Being online,Instructor availability on campus,"I think the only thing that could improve the teaching would be include more examples, for example the videos"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,coding instructing,Its online so it isn't the most engaging course and it requires you to be willing to put in the effort and teach yourself,I wish there were another excel module and we could have learned other things like pivot tables.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Content was presented in an easy to understand manner. Assignments were fair and helped me learn the content as I went along.

Use of LEARN discussion boards was helpful.",Lack of feedback on quizzes.,I would like a mixture of lectures and notes. Reading text off of a page is boring and makes it difficult to learn sometimes. I'd also like to see more examples in the excel section.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Course presentation was good,materials are disorganized and incomplete. Trying to achieve too much in too little time. HTML and CSS should be a course of its own.,I'm not sure that Module 9 was useful for me. I spent more time on worrying about the var weights for my web page than anything else. There was some confusion towards the end because some things had to be shifted around.Sometimes uploading to the student.cs website didn't work properly. I'm not sure if that was us or the program. I think there should be more about responsive design and accessibility requirements for websites.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Easy to follow and assignments were very helpful in both practical and theoretical.,more detailed examples,Improve everything in weaknesses
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,easy to understand,"Much of the assignments are left to the student to interpret how the instructor wants it done. Any further clarification would have been done via e-mail and the rate of responsiveness depends on the availability of the instructor/IA's. In addition, because this course is online, it requires those unable to ""study"" effectively from a screen to hand write, or print out the notes.",In my opinion this course might be better as a physical course rather than an online course
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Easy, interesting, and applicable.",N/A,in-person office hours
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Educational and clearly laid out for tech-idiots.,N/A,Instructional videos for excel or html formulae and code so the assignments aren't as confusing (as they were)
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Gives a good intro to CS.,no in-person tutorial/ office hours,It might potentially help to have an online final assignment rather than a written exam to best suit this course's content.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,gives great background information for common applications like excel and html.,"No videos, learning content only through short/brief readings",Keep the module on security. I think that topic is very important
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"good communication and deadline extensions from TA's 
I liked the 7 late days allowed",None,less excel
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,good course,none,Less memes and internet trends. Such cringe.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Good molecules. Clear to follow.,None to mention...,Make assignments more simple. Two two to three different parts.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Good notes, strong emphasis on the important points",Not able to connect through on-campus study groups,"Maybe use more live videos/tutorials on how to do apply concepts (like what was done with the Excel modules).
- Try to make the modules flow better
- Maybe record videos of the modules being lectured; just reading slides felt at times as if I was read"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Great explanation. Follows material in logical order which students can follow.,Not all content for quizzes is found in the content section. Excel unit was challenging and parts of it seemed purposeless or just challenging for no reason. (horizontal Vlookups),"Modules for the ""excel"" unit weren't as well put or helpful as I wanted to be. I was more dependent on videos on the internet for my learning."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,great skills to learn for everyday living,Not much. A few changes needed but this course is in flux.,"More focus on html, Css and java. I do not think that excel needed to be focused on as much"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Highly organized, professor makes good analogies using everyday objects/situations to explain complicated technological processes",Nothing.,"More practical assignments, doing more with Excel if possible, as well as possibly teaching how to use database software (MS Access?), as that is sometimes a requirement or qualification for jobs."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I found the material very interesting,"Online course is not very engaging, difficult to stay motivated and get questions answered.",More readings regarding html and more examples to help with assignments
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned so many new things about Microsoft Excel, and html, and just stuff to do with computers. It was a good and knowledgeable course to take.","Since its online, it becomes a hassle compared to the day courses",More specific in requirements for activities and clearer on particular elements we are required to replicate. The assignments were redundant and very time consuming becaue of the level of difficulty.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Information is presented in a clear manner, and somewhat interesting to read",Some content could be explained in more simpler terms,More videos need to be provided as supplementary material.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Instructor help and availability.,some content was unclear,More videos to demonstrate how things are done
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Interesting and relatable topic.,Some excel questions were hard to understand what I was supposed to do,N/A
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Interesting material,Some material could have been explained more in depth and more examples could have been provided (i.e. html and css),N/A
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,it helped me understand more about computers,Some modules (like module 10) are very long and dull,None
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It is a good intro course for students interested in learning about CS,Some of the analogies used to explain concepts. Too confusing and convoluted!,None
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It is interesting and I got to learn a lot more about computers as I do have an interest in them,"Some of the assignments were repetitive (ie. making a webpage twice, making one would have sufficed)",Nothing I can think of. Well done!
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Learning programs and functions in the assignments,"Some of the assignments were very time-consuming and when doing it with a full course load, it can be overwhelming.",Nothing more than what is already being done.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Little bit of humour in the modules.,Some of the content was quite boring (first few weeks).,"Nothing, did an amazing job!"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lots of great information, enjoyed learning about computers",Some of the explanations were not helpful and were confusing to understand.,Nothing. Great as is!
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,some of the modules could have been explained a little more clearly,Offer an optional tutorial time within class schedules. I would have been more inclined to attend this than office hours.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No textbook, all info is available on learn - one location for everything.","Some of the modules were not very effective in my opinion, they need a little more hands components while you are going through them.",One thing that this course can be improved on is probably make the assignments more concise because some of the assignments were kind of tedious to perform.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,online quizzes,Some of the quiz questions were a little too tricky.,Online how to tutorials
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Online version- self-taught,some of the web page stuffs were a little bit too intense,"open up the quiz answers so i can review them, use as study notes
still unsure how i should/can prepare for the final exam"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,organization,"some parts were fairly confusing, i especially struggled with the excel functions","Overall, I think it is very well done."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"organization
TA assistance",Sometimes being unable to reach the TA on time,Personalized videos
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Real world application of CS, applicable skills for those not looking to code.","Sometimes concepts were a bit difficult, but I did use the ISA's a lot","Please cover basic Python, even the most rudimentary stuff. I have been self teaching it to myself on the side through the free course that Waterloo just put out and am loving it. I wish that CS 100 would cut out the basic computer module (ie. ""What is hardware"", ""What is software"") and put a module about Python."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"relevant material
i assume it is difficult to explain, so considering, it was explained fairly well",Sometimes does not provide enough information/instruction for students to complete the assignments,please explain the module 7 and 8 a little bit more because they are relatively hard to understand
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Self paced, practical applications","sometimes some of the modules can be hard to understand, and can be clearer but overall excellent course",Provide a more in-depth video of the INDIRECT function.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,teach useful basics of computer applications,Sometimes the T.A take longer to reply back to certain messages.,Provide more specific instructions in the Dynamic Web Pages module regarding how to apply Javascript to the assignment
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Teaching excel and coding in a way that gets students to think about the course,"Specifically the excel as well as html units, they weren't very well taught and could have more detail to avoid confusion and such difficulty with the assignments.",Reduce the number of lectures/modules on
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,that you have a week to complete assignments,Still some grammatical errors in the slides.,"Since it is a CS course, I think some tutorials would have been very helpful with learning how to code. With tutorials, the teacher can point out the important syntax errors/ key points so that there is more benefit as opposed to when the student, who has little to no experience with HTML and JavaScript, has to look for these things."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The ability to explain and teach the material,Terminology was confusing,"Some assignments took much longer than others. Warning ahead of time about the length could have helped to time manage better. Some of the heavier assignments overlapped with midterms, would be better placed at beginning of course."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The amount of information that is taught. I really learned a lot and it was quite interesting throughout.,That assignments are multiple choice and also practical. Sometimes there are too many aspects in an assignment.,Some assignments were excessive. More structure could be given for coding and formatting it.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The assignments,The assignments included questions and work that was never taught. The last few assignments were far too difficult compared to what was outlined in the lecture. I had to get a friend who is in 4th software engineering to help because nothing was explained well previously.,Some instructions for assignments were vague
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The assignments that were not quizzes were extremely helpful,"The computer section, the quizzes, the delayed marking",Some instructions or things in the quiz weren't directly taught in the modules
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The assignments were fun and I learned a lot,The excel wasn't helpful,"Some more information should have been given on how to specifically do the assignements. If there's no text book, all the needed information  to do the The assignments should be available in the modules."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The clear instructions provided for the assignments and some of the examples were a great help,The first few modules on excel etc,Students may be more involved if the course could be related to social media more since it is such a big part of today's culture
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The course content is organized effectively week by week, and feedback and assistance were timely and responsive.",The lack of video tutorials.,TAs need to be more professional when addressing questions
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The excel portion.,the quizzes vary in difficulty a lot.,"The instructions for assignments were unclear, lots of unnecessary information. Would have liked to see more in depth learning about excel graphs, as they have been a big part of lab components of my courses and they are not always as simple as the ones that are presented in this course."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The explanations for assignments were clear and the content was clearly explained.,The quizzes.,"There is no teaching, it's all online modules."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The fact that there are weekly assignments and deadlines helps me keep on top of my work,The TA's don't specify when they give extensions until which day at an earlier time.,"To explain concepts better, I had to look up a lot of things to understand what was trying to be explained. Also, to"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The format of the assignments,The webdesign practical assignments for modules 8 and 9 required a lot of self-taught learning from sources outside of the modules/given course content. I understand that this is good in encouraging students to research and learn more on their own but this made completing the assignments on my own more difficult as not all the information was given in the course notes.,To have more office hours/ chat hours. especially in person
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The html was fun,The whole course is text based. It's like reading a text book.,too take out the pointless definitions and try not to overcomplicate the content
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The material was explained very well.,There were too many delays in uploading the modules. The instructions for assignments were really vague,Update the information slides to encompass more relevant and current technologies.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,the modules are well written and they contain great examples,"This course is showing the techniques a lot and also theories but when they introduce technique on the lecture note, hard to understand techniques  by words and paragraphs.",Videos or audio would be more interesting than simply reading material every week.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"the modules, having office/ chat hours, and fast response to email and having excellent ISAs",This course was very repetitive and the material was disappointing. From a computer course I was under the impression I would learn more about computers than be forced to do useless things with excel and create websites. Most of the content was useless.,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The pace, and the way the content is introduced.","very unorganized.. 
TAs and instructor did not respective the deadline the assignments should be posted on multiple occasions which was annoying",
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The practical assignments with Excel and HTML/CSS, which were actually quite fun.",way too many unnecessary definitions,
