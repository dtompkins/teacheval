He is very good at his oral and visual presentations of material to students. This allows for better understanding, especially since we're learning so much new stuff in CS136.","I would suggest Dave to incorporate more stories or something to retain our attention. Especially after that lesson with arrays and pointers, everyone around me had the dead fish look, where we all were dazed with glazed eyes. A small break or refresher would have allowed more information to sink in and given us time to absorb what was given to us.",The material is very interesting and is definitely useful for jobs outside of school,"The secret tests on Marmoset are so arbitrary. Even if you pass your basic tests, you still might get a 60 on the assignment. I felt that this was too secret, as it is just like putting a bag over your head and walking into the bad side of town hoping you don't get beat up or mugged whilst walking.Additionally, I don't think that the hand marking should be so rigid. In the first day of class, we talked about how in a class, there can be a large variety of possible solutions to a problem depending on who programs it. Even if our solutions are slightly slower or less efficient, we are students who have been exposed to  this material for less than a week. To expect picture perfect code is unreasonable in my perspective.","The class atmosphere was good. No complaints, no matter who asked questions, Dave would respond in the same manner.","Assignment 9 was too long. For an assignment that expands on our thinking, (dynamically located 'array' within another dynamically located string) that was the basis for 4 questions was too hard. If it is an expansion of our learning, ie. coding with stuff we haven't been taught or have seen from the lesson slides, there should be a significantly reduced number of questions. The Pantry question was frankly stupid and it was too ambitious, which lead to CS students ACTUALLY going to the tutorial office, thus leading to an extension."
