While 135 went very well, 115 was a little more difficult "behind the scenes".  The two courses had a very different culture and philosophy and I had a hard time adjusting between the two.  There were also changes in the course content that was hard to keep track of.<br><br>
In the classroom things went pretty smoothly, but because I was used to teaching 135 I did go through some of the material too quickly.
