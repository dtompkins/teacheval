This repository [https://github.com/dtompkins/teacheval] stores the teaching evaluations for me (Dave Tompkins) [https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~dtompkin/].

I firmly believe in being open and transparent about my teaching, and this repository is part of my ongoing commitment to improve my teaching.

It contains:

1) The raw data for ALL of the evaluations (good and bad) that I have received from my students, including their individual comments.

and

2) The python scripts to take that raw data, along with some template files to automatically generate the pretty pages located at: https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~dtompkin/teaching/
